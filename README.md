## 1) **Step one:** 
I did web scrapping of the scripts of all 200 How I Met Your Mother TV show. The function I created iterated over 200 endpoints, as well as cleaning the data and concatenating them to end up with a single dataframe for all the episodes.

## 2) **Step two:**
Introducing all of the data into MYSQL. I found a special difficuly here introducing the episode.

## 3) **Step three:**
For this step I had to create an API using Flask, where I will be able to access different information, to do add new phrases, or to do the sentiment analysis of a certain character in a certain episode.
