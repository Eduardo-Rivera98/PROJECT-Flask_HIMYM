1,11, The Limo, I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?,Barney

1,11, The Limo, *A bad name*,Ranjit
1,11, The Limo, It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff.,Ted
1,11, The Limo," No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...",Ted
1,11, The Limo, I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from?,Ted
1,11, The Limo, That's ridiculous. Wait. Really?,Ted
1,11, The Limo, I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.,Lily
1,11, The Limo," Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.",Ted
1,11, The Limo," The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am.",Barney

1,11, The Limo, Marshall!,Lily

1,11, The Limo," Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me?",Lily
1,11, The Limo," I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there.",Marshall

1,11, The Limo, Cheers.,All

1,11, The Limo," You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story. Well, don't. Not every night has a happy ending. But all of it's important. All of it was leading somewhere. Because suddenly, it was 2006. And 2006 was a big one.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,11, The Limo," What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal.",Robin

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," No, no.",Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, These look kinda like blood.,Lily
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?",Marshall

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye.",Robin

1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.,Marshall
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.,Barney

1,10, The Pineapple Incident,"  Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?",Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, That worked. I hate the world.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.",Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Doo-doo.,Marshall

1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Oh yes it can.,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Interesting,Marshall
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.",Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," So, what? You want me to do a shot.",Ted

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," So, there were some unanswered questions.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, How much did I drink? How did I sprain my ankle?,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, And who was this girl in my bed?,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," OK, what the hell happened last night?",Ted

1,10, The Pineapple Incident, That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.,Robin

1,10, The Pineapple Incident, And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?,Marshall
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Who is she?,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I have no idea.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Nice.,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, You really don't know who that is?,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," No, after I hosed you down with a beverage gun, I brought you back here.",Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I better not have gotten burned.,Ted

1,10, The Pineapple Incident, It's Ted.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," It's Carl, from the bar.",Carl
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, And then Carl filled us in.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Sleep it off, bra.",Barney

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Yeah, this'll go good.",Carl
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway.

1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Thanks Carl.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, It's Robin. That's Robin in there.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Did you guys?,Marshall

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," All right, right over here.",Lily
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Someone get him a shot, he's thinking again.",Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad.",Marshall
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up.,Lily
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Wake her up and say what?,Ted

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Hey, Robin, how are you?",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by?",Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Ask her about the pineapple.,Marshall
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Yeah, sure, come on over.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Thanks.,Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," No, wait, don't, no.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, She's coming over. Crap.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Wait, this is killing me. We have to find out who that girl is.",Lily
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Trudy. My name is Trudy.,Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, And then Trudy filled us in.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.",Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Daddy's home.,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Or the one after that.,Trudy

1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Ladies.,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I love everyone in this bar.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, He's kinda cute.,Trudy

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Sorry, Trudy, go on.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I liked your performance.,Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.",Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Do it.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid.",Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," I'm something stupid, do me.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, You're funny.,Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, That's hauntingly beautiful.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Hey, it works.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.,Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I need to make one more call.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Hello.,Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Hey, it's me again.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Hey.,Trudy

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed.",Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.",Marshall
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Why, is that your girlfriend?",Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this.",Trudy
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Hi.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Hey guys.,Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Robin.,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Hi Robin.,Lily
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Top of the morning.,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.",Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Let's go get a snack.,Lily
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I love to snack.,Marshall
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I'm good.,Barney
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Come on, those calls weren't that weird.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident,"  Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, That goes on for three-and a half minutes.,Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.",Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Really, you moved on?",Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Yes. What, you don't believe me?",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Oh, OK.",Ted

1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Trudy, come on out.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Trudy?,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.",Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.",Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Yes, you did, last night.",Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident, Really? Well.,Ted
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.",Robin
1,10, The Pineapple Incident," I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments, and they make life worth living. But here's the problem, moments pass, and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel, unshaven b*st*rd named reality.",Future Ted(Narrator)

1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is.""",Barney

1,13," Drumroll, Please", This wasn't how I thought the night would turn out.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,13," Drumroll, Please", This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin. But then reality came along.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 o'clock news. It was her big break.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," And I went to the wedding stag. Then, when I least expected it...",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I had the most amazing night ever.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley.",Marshall

1,13," Drumroll, Please", I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Wedding goggles.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", This isn't the moves?,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", That's too bad.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Tell me about it.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," You know, I think I have a solution.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Interested.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Less interested.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Go ahead.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", What are you saying?,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Unless...,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Wow. OK, I'm in.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", OK.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," I guess, what, we'll need fake names?",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Um, you can call me Buttercup.",Victoria

1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea.",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake.",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," That cake really got to you, huh?",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", It haunts me.,Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," So, what happened next?",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Mm-hm.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.,Victoria

1,13," Drumroll, Please", Kiss.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Go. Go, go, go",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", You're not gonna do it at your wedding?,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," So, where did you guys go?",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Very nice.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Yeah?,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I couldn't really tell.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", No you couldn't.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", You're a dude. I could totally...,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Totally get some.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", We're not gonna kiss tonight.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", OK.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", But we can't kiss.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", OK.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",Lily

1,13," Drumroll, Please"," So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Ted?,Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me.",Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," 24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her?",Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I've moved on.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes.",Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.",Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Thank God.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.",Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please", There was no Victoria at the wedding.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Marshall. She was not a ghost.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?,Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", You know I did.,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", You know I won't.,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Why not?,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I'm ready to be proven wrong.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please","  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please",  What kind of shoes...,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please","  Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Actually.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Oh come on.,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Hey.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," So, what do you want to do next?",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Uh...,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Hold this.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Whoa. There she goes.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please",  Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I understand.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.,Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Agreed.,Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," And I thought that was the end of it, but then...",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Congrats, that's so cool.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it...",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,13," Drumroll, Please", What?,Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I know who she is.,Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Actually, I kind of was.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", What?,Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?,Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Hello? You OK in there?,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying?",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Because you have feelings for Ted.,Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," I don't know, maybe.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.,Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.,Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.,Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I'm gonna go find him.,Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I have no idea.,Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x.",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Hi, guys,",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Hey.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Sure. What's up?,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Uh, I, I have to tell you something.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Oh.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, just get it.",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Hello.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?!,Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.,Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Cake.,Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",Robin
1,13," Drumroll, Please", We got it at this little bakery downtown.,Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Actually, neither.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", It's called the Buttercup Bakery.,Claudia
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I made the cake.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", She made the cake.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please", I'm going down to that bakery.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," No, no, don't do it.",Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Baby, what are you talking about?!",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Going. Getting.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Yes! No.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Oh come on!,Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Wow, what was I thinking?",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," You got me, you are good.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Buttercup Bakery. This is it.,Lily
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",Marshall
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Ted, you still with us?",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Tell me your last name.,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please", What's that?,Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Hey, Ted.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please", Yeah?,Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," Close your eyes, and count to five.",Victoria
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," One, two, three, four, five.",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",Ted
1,13," Drumroll, Please"," The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",Barney
1,13," Drumroll, Please", OK.,Ted

1,1, Pilot," Yes.  Twenty-five years ago, before I was dad, I had this whole other life.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,1, Pilot," It was way back in 2005. I was twenty-seven just starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with my friend Marshall, my best friend from college. My life was good and then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,1, Pilot,  Will you marry me.,Marshall

1,1, Pilot, I did that one time.,Ted
1,1, Pilot, It was a blazer!,Barney
1,1, Pilot," You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call ""Uncle Ted"".",Ted

1,1, Pilot," Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live.  Barney, we met at the urinal.",Barney

1,1, Pilot," Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.",Ted
1,1, Pilot," I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend.",Barney
1,1, Pilot," You're my best friend, Barney.",Ted
1,1, Pilot," Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... ""Have you met Ted?""",Barney
1,1, Pilot," Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing ""Have You Met Ted?""",Ted

1,1, Pilot,"  Hi, I'm Ted.",Ted
1,1, Pilot, It's a very pretty name.,Ted
1,1, Pilot, Hey!,Marshall

1,1, Pilot," Yes, I am.",Marshall
1,1, Pilot, Aww- Are you sure that's a good idea after last time? You looked really creepy without eyebrows.,Lily
1,1, Pilot, I can handle this; I'm full of surprises tonight.,Marshall

1,1, Pilot," I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.",Ted
1,1, Pilot," Well maybe eventually. Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park. Simple ceremony, we'll write our own vows. But--eh--no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it! Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged?  Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh?",Ted
1,1, Pilot," Well, you're clearly drunk  ONE MORE FOR THE LADY!",Ted
1,1, Pilot," Okay, look what I got ",Marshall
1,1, Pilot, Aw-honey. Champagne! ,Lily
1,1, Pilot,  Yeah. ,Marshall

1,1, Pilot, Then open it!,Lily
1,1, Pilot, Fine  Please open it ,Marshall
1,1, Pilot," You are unbelievable, Marshall. No-",Lily

1,1, Pilot, Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down.,Ted
1,1, Pilot,  how does Carl land a Lebanese girl?,Barney
1,1, Pilot," It's always been ""don't even think about it till you're thirty""",Ted
1,1, Pilot, Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!,Barney
1,1, Pilot," Plus Marshall's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, ""Okay, I'm ready! Where is she?"" ",Ted
1,1, Pilot, and there she was.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,1, Pilot," It was like something from an old movie. Where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, ""see that girl? I'm going to marry her someday""",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,1, Pilot," Hey Barney, see that girl?",Ted
1,1, Pilot,"  Hey, have you met Ted?",Barney
1,1, Pilot," Let me guess,  Ted?",Robin
1,1, Pilot," I'm sorry, Lily. I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.",Marshall
1,1, Pilot," Hit me? Please, this guy could barely even spank me in bed for fun. He's all like,  ""Oh, did that hurt?"" and I'm like, ""Come on, let me have it you pansy!""  Wow, complete stranger.",Lily
1,1, Pilot, So what do you do?,Ted
1,1, Pilot, I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.,Robin
1,1, Pilot,  Oh.,Ted
1,1, Pilot," Well, kind of a reporter. I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know. Like-um-monkey that can play the ukulele. I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.",Robin
1,1, Pilot," Bigger like, uh, gorilla with an up-right bass? Sorry, you're really pretty.  Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.",Ted
1,1, Pilot," Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend so tonight every guy is... ""The enemy"".",Robin
1,1, Pilot, You know if you don't make your friend feel better you could throw a drink at my face. I don't mind.,Ted
1,1, Pilot, She would love that! It does look fun in the movies.,Robin
1,1, Pilot," Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",Ted
1,1, Pilot," Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday. Some guys attempting to make a big  so my news is covering it.",Robin

1,1, Pilot, Wow that is one bad-ass blue French horn.,Robin
1,1, Pilot, Yeah.,Ted
1,1, Pilot, Mhmm.,Robin
1,1, Pilot, Sort of looks like a... Smurf pen1s.,Ted
1,1, Pilot," Son, a piece of advice. When you go on a first date you really don't wanna say ""smurf pen1s"". Girls don't ordinarily like that.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,1, Pilot, But that was no ordinary girl.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,1, Pilot, Lilly?,Marshall
1,1, Pilot, How long have you been sitting there!? Stupid eye patch.,Lily
1,1, Pilot," Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby! Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman?",Ted

1,1, Pilot, And I'm saving the best for last.,Ted
1,1, Pilot, Do you want these?  I hate olives.,Robin
1,1, Pilot, She hates olives! Awesome!,Marshall
1,1, Pilot, The olive theory.,Lily
1,1, Pilot," The olive theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance .",Ted
1,1, Pilot," You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.",Robin
1,1, Pilot,  I can take them off your hands.,Ted

1,1, Pilot, Yeah.,Ted
1,1, Pilot, So? Did you kiss her?,Marshall

1,1, Pilot," Aww, Ted that's so sweet. So you chickened out like the little bitch.",Lily
1,1, Pilot, What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.,Ted
1,1, Pilot," Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.",Lily
1,1, Pilot,"  Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I killed you Connor; don't make me get your mom!",Barney

1,1, Pilot," Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two? ",Barney

1,8, The Duel, They sent you a notice about this.,Wendy
1,8, The Duel, When?,Lily
1,8, The Duel, Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines.,Wendy
1,8, The Duel," Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease.",Marshall

1,8, The Duel, She may be 98 years old but she's still...,Lily

1,8, The Duel, Really?,Lily
1,8, The Duel, Of course.,Ted
1,8, The Duel," You sure about this, Ted?",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, What? What are you talking about?,Ted
1,8, The Duel, And why is that girl checking you out?,Robin
1,8, The Duel," Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, so?",Ted
1,8, The Duel," So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, we've talked about it.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Who?,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Future Ted and Future Marshall.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Dammit Past Ted,Ted
1,8, The Duel," You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?",Robin
1,8, The Duel, Sort of on a date with her.,Barney
1,8, The Duel, What?,Ted
1,8, The Duel," I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile.  But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, All right.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, You're going to the hospital?,Robin
1,8, The Duel," No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",Robin
1,8, The Duel," He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",Robin
1,8, The Duel, I should really make this call.,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Ooh, can I do it?",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.",Robin
1,8, The Duel, Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?,Barney
1,8, The Duel," Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, See you guys later.,Barney
1,8, The Duel," Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, What happened to Shocky?,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",Ted
1,8, The Duel, You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",Robin
1,8, The Duel, It's not just the coffeemaker.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, Done. The painting's done.,Lily
1,8, The Duel, That is great.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Nice.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, Where do you wanna hang it?,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," I don't know. Um, over the piano?",Lily
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",Ted
1,8, The Duel, OK.,Lily
1,8, The Duel, He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",Ted
1,8, The Duel," You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," What, like buy a new sofa?",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Bigger.,Barney
1,8, The Duel," Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," A lemon law, like for cars.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, Hi Katie. Barney.,Barney
1,8, The Duel," Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved ""Ted"" into that block of cheese.",Lily
1,8, The Duel," Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel, He's not cool with me moving in.,Lily
1,8, The Duel," No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," So, what's he PMS'ing about?",Lily
1,8, The Duel, I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.,Lily
1,8, The Duel, He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.,Lily
1,8, The Duel, You clearly don't know Ted.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Your English phone booth arrived.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Oh, awesome. It's great, right?",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Exactly.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, Great,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Terrific.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Oh, so it's like that, is it?",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Bring, bring.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, it's like that.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel, I want this apartment.,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Well, I want it too.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!",Barney
1,8, The Duel," For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?,Barney
1,8, The Duel," Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Bad move, Scherbatsky.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Hi, have you met Robin?",Barney
1,8, The Duel, Hi.,Robin
1,8, The Duel," All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Or we could flip a coin.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, let's flip a coin.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Flip it.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Flip it.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," OK, here I go.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Flip it.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, You don't need two rooms,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?",Ted
1,8, The Duel, We might be starting a family soon.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?,Ted
1,8, The Duel," My fiancé...suddenly, she's my fiancé.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," I deserve this apartment, Marshall.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, No more than I do.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Great, so let's flip for it.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Flip it.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?",Ted
1,8, The Duel, I guess so.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?,Ted
1,8, The Duel, We should probably figure that out.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," It's OK, it's OK.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Can I observe something?,Ted
1,8, The Duel, That this is kinda awesome?,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Totally.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, I can't believe we didn't do this before.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, I know!,Ted
1,8, The Duel, Thank you.,Robin
1,8, The Duel, It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.,Robin
1,8, The Duel, Just a second.,Robin
1,8, The Duel, Hello.,Robin
1,8, The Duel,"  Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, Leave me alone.,Robin
1,8, The Duel, We're only just getting to know each other.,Robin
1,8, The Duel, Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.,Barney
1,8, The Duel, Sorry.,Robin
1,8, The Duel," No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.",Robin
1,8, The Duel, That was awesome.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, I know.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, Do it again.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel, What?,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Anhedonic?,Ted
1,8, The Duel, Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.,Ted
1,8, The Duel," I know, this rules.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Yeah it did.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, You remember when we first got these swords?,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, It was the day we moved in.,Ted
1,8, The Duel," Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Yeah.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Oh God, I'll be right there.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.",Robin
1,8, The Duel," No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.",Robin
1,8, The Duel, I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Is she OK?,Robin
1,8, The Duel, They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.",Barney
1,8, The Duel," It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.",Barney
1,8, The Duel, But you're totally...,Robin
1,8, The Duel, Just let him have this one.,Ted
1,8, The Duel, That's us.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, A sword fight?,Lily
1,8, The Duel," On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fiancé ran me through with a frickin' broad sword.",Lily
1,8, The Duel," Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",Lily
1,8, The Duel, You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," Uh, you know, if I tried...",Marshall
1,8, The Duel," Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.",Lily
1,8, The Duel, Gonna miss the old place.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.,Lily
1,8, The Duel," Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.",Ted
1,8, The Duel, Totally.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking but I'm starving.,Lily
1,8, The Duel, Let's go get some dinner.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, I know just the place.,Lily
1,8, The Duel," Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.",Ted
1,8, The Duel," I told you. OK, a toast.",Lily
1,8, The Duel," Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff.",Lily
1,8, The Duel, And to the lemon law.,Barney
1,8, The Duel, Self-clink.,Barney
1,8, The Duel," And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses.",Lily
1,8, The Duel, I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.,Marshall
1,8, The Duel, I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year.,Lily
1,8, The Duel," Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, Oh my God.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," I know, I'm still shaking.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, What happened?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," We saw something, up in the apartment.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Something bad.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, Oh my God.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, What was it?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, Marshall ran away from a cockroach.,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," It, it was a mouse.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret?",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, Was that chick at the end really a client?,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, Yes.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, We're signing up.,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, What?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, It was a cockroach.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Oh my God.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, Come on.,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, What?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, My boat is sinking.,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, You have a boat?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Your boat is sinking. That was good.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. ",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, You deserve more.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, of course you can. That is so...",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, Get out.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, What?,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh my God, people do that.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," OK, Ted, let's go.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," Not you, you stay.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, Get outta here!,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, Do you take credit cards?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, It's bigger now. It's been feeding.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, We were just upstairs watching TV.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, Ah gosh.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," OK, let's do this.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, So did you get a good look at it?,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, It's a cockamouse.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, What?,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, That's impossible. That simply can't happen.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, but it can.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, And it has,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, And it's pissed.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, There was no time.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, Did you just use my name as a verb?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, You said it was gonna be three days.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Did I?,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, Hm.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Three days? Really?,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Well, I'm not.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, A little bi maybe?,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," No. You're messing with me, right?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Come see for yourself.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, There's a 9.6 right there.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, 8.5.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, So he sucks.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, And it's the size of a potato.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," That's right, I did the math.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,7, Matchmaker, Hi.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Hi, I'm Ted.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Friday night?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, I'm sure you do.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?",Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, Aliens.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, You can't be serious.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," My friend, you just poked the bear.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Oh.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Oh geez.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, What?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," When suddenly, an array of",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, The doctor will see you now.,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker,  Happy ending.,Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," All right, see you later. Happy hunting.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker," Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.",Barney
1,7, Matchmaker, Oh my God!,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker," Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, Hello again.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Anything else?,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Wait, then you're still getting married.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, But we're a 9.6.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, You're right.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, What?,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Robin.,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, What?,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, Oh my God. It's real.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," Oh, is it? Do something.",Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?,Lily
1,7, Matchmaker, It was the only think I could think of.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker, Lily thank God.,Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Lily, I love you.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker," Robin, open the window!",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, It can fly.,Robin
1,7, Matchmaker," Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.",Marshall
1,7, Matchmaker, Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché?",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, It's for the bourbon.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker," No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.",Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, No you won't.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker, Yes I will,Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, You're losing me.,Ellen
1,7, Matchmaker," Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.",Ted
1,7, Matchmaker, So I should keep looking?,Ellen
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Guess what came in the mail today?,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Our costumes? Do they rule?,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, They rule. And yours is 100% wool so you won't get hypothermia like last year.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Tarzan nipple blue.,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse...",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, She's a slutty nurse.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Mike? There's a Mike? You have a boyfriend? You haven't told us?,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, So why haven't we met him?,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, We're not really ready to go public yet.,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, How about we go about a Halloween double-date?,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Come on, Robin, trot our your new fella. Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened?",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Your costumes came.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Our costumes...yes, that is why we're best friends.",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween?",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Well.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, What?,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Every Halloween Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, That's right.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, What's the Slutty Pumpkin?,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, It was carved in strategic places.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua...",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Kahlua and root beer,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, A cocktail she invented herself.,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, And she...,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, And she called it the Tootsie Roll.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something...",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Guys! Something went terribly wrong.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Happy Halloween.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Sonny, where's Cher?",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Cher?,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Right here, babe.",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks?,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Loves them.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve.",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," I don't know, but we have plenty of chocolate here.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it?",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Uh-oh.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, Dracula. Come on. Give me your candy. Gimme!",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat!,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat.",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh, on the off chance that that could happen, maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Can't wait.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," So, what do you think?",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin,"  So, what do you think? ",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Wow! Marshall, you wearing eye liner?",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right?",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, We are so gonna win the costume contest this year.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," First prize, $50 gift certificate at the bar.",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, And how much did you pay for your costumes?,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, $100,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin,  Each.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Well, I think you guys look great.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," What are you going as? Oh, like I even have to ask.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, What? She thought it was hilarious.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," All right, Polly gotta pee.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Again?,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Where are you going?,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, It's an elaborate costume.,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up!",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hm,  Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or  Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word.",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, I'm heading up to the roof.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice.  We out.",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Hey, word play. Funny.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin,  Whoo.,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin,  Nice outfit.,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, I'm a parrot.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, You sure are.,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Where's Mike?,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year.,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Seriously, does my eye liner look OK?",Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Yes, it's weirdly hot.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh, geez.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Hi.,Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Where's your costume, Gretel?",Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, I can't believe you talked me into this.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, I didn't. You followed me up here.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, There are six chicks here.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Arr-gyle.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Arrr-by's,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Actually I kinda need this hand to eat.,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Oh.,Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together. We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's ",Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, This cheeseburger is so...,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Good. See.,Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby. This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chop.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, That might be true but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit.,Marshall
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin,"  Robin, you have to try this chicken.",Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Really tasty.,Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Come on, just try a little bite.",Mike
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Oh for God's sake. ,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Really tasty.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Hey.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah.",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, It isn't funny if you explain the joke.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Let's bail.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Name one person you know at this party.,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle. ",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Really? That's the nickname now?,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Yeah, the Barnacle.",Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, The Barnacle.,Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, That's it. Barnacle out. ,Barney
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Have fun, Barnacle.",Ted
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," So, do you like Mike?",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Do you like Mike?,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Of course I do. Why?,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume.,Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff.",Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, Are you trying to get me to join a cult?,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.",Lily
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin, What?,Robin
1,6, Slutty Pumpkin," Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night.",Lily

1,5, Okay Awesome, I don't know guys. It's not awkward unless we let it be awkward.,Marshall
1,5, Okay Awesome, This place seems great. Is Kelly here?,Ted
1,5, Okay Awesome," Yeah, she's around somewhere. Let's go find her, I'll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn't it, who get's to be in VIP and who doesn't?",Robin

1,5, Okay Awesome," It's dipping stuff in hot cheese, what's not to love?",Lily

1,5, Okay Awesome," Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.",Lily
1,5, Okay Awesome, Marshall knew she was right. He had to stop acting like a kid.,Future Ted(Narrator)

1,5, Okay Awesome, Or parades.,Ted
1,5, Okay Awesome, I really hate parades. ,Ted

1,5, Okay Awesome," Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night?",Robin
1,5, Okay Awesome, Don't check your email.,Lily
1,5, Okay Awesome, Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.,Robin
1,5, Okay Awesome," Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I'm not in college anymore. I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards you can only go forward.",Lily
1,5, Okay Awesome," Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go?",Robin
1,5, Okay Awesome, I want to go into this club and find my fiancé.,Lily

1,5, Okay Awesome," Wanna bet?  Follow my lead.  Hey, big guy.  I said follow my lead.",Lily

1,5, Okay Awesome," That was my cousin, Leslie.",Barney
1,5, Okay Awesome,  What?!,Ted
1,5, Okay Awesome," No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months.

1,2, Purple Giraffe, Hello?,Marshall
1,2, Purple Giraffe,"  hey, am I interrupting anything? ",Ted

1,2, Purple Giraffe," So, Gatsby, what are you goanna do when Robin shows up?",Marshall
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Okay, I got it all planned out.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," She steps through the door, and where's Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, ""Hey, what's up?"" She says, ""Hey, nice place"" etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, ""Well make yourself at home,"" and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, ""Oh, you're still here?"" I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise. And then very casually, ""Wanna see the roof?""",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe, Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.,Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe, What's so special about the roof?,Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline. You can't not fall in love on that roof.",Lily
1,2, Purple Giraffe, We do it up there sometimes.,Marshall
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Solid plan, my little friend.",Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe, We're the same height.,Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe, But may I suggest one little modification.,Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe," That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have s*x with her! Crazy monkey-style.",Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe, That's not the plan.,Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!",Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Yeah, but she's not Robin.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this?",Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Barney, I don't wanna say-",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Aargh!  Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!",Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe, Man you're a dork.,Lily
1,2, Purple Giraffe," beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call ""Have You Met Ted?""",Barney

1,2, Purple Giraffe, Hey little old books. Ready for a little fifteen minute recess?,Lily

1,2, Purple Giraffe," Okay, where the hell is my-OHH!  Okay, introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923...is not a coaster! Ted! I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up.  I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin?  Hi! Hi Robin. ",Marshall
1,2, Purple Giraffe, so you threw all these parties for me?,Robin
1,2, Purple Giraffe," No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I--one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh- this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it -Anyway Robin, this is.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Okay, buddy, time for the ""tough-talk"". Robin seems great. But let's look at the facts, you wanna get married and right now there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you, but Robin ain't one of them.",Lily
1,2, Purple Giraffe," She's not just ""one of them"" she's the one.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Yeah well, ""the one"" is heading up to ""the roof"". ",Barney
1,2, Purple Giraffe, What are you gonna do?,Marshall
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Nothing. It's a game, I gotta just-keep playing it.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe, Hey.,Robin
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Hey. Carlos, can you give us a minute?",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Robin, look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that.  I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.",Ted

1,2, Purple Giraffe," There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe,"  you're not crazy. I-I don't know, Ted, I mean we barely know each other and you're looking at me with that look and it's like-",Robin

1,2, Purple Giraffe,  It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl.,Robin
1,2, Purple Giraffe," No, I'm not.",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe," Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.",Robin
1,2, Purple Giraffe,  Click. Off. Let's make out.,Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe,  What?,Robin
1,2, Purple Giraffe," What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof.",Ted

1,2, Purple Giraffe," I don't know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, ""Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass.""",Ted
1,2, Purple Giraffe, You're not a jackass. I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working and-I just haven't met a lot of good people so far. But I understand.,Robin

1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked.",Barney

1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty,"  Listen to me, you're both American citizens. Don't let them pull any patriot-act voodoo.

1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Dude, I think that guy is gay.",Robin
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty,"  Oh, I know that guy is gay. Just Marshall and I have been together for nine years. I haven't been single since high school.",Lily
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," You wanna be single?  You wanna fight off loser guys all night, does that seem like fun to you?",Robin
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," I guess I wanted to throw this net back into the ocean and see how many fish I could catch. So far, one. One gay dolphin. ",Lily
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," And Marshall. Lily, all these girls here tonight are looking to catch what you've already got.",Robin
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty, You're right I know. Hey do you wanna get some coffee and have an actual conversation?,Lily

1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Marshall, he's gay!",Lily
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Oh, thank god... I've never been in a fight before. ",Marshall
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," So it turns out Uncle Marshall really was the jealous type. Unfortunately, that guys boyfriend... also the jealous type.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty, Hey!,Lily
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty, Could have licked the Liberty Bell.,Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty, We're going to the airport.,Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Bong, bong...",Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!",Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Ted, Ted... you're not even looking.",Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," No, I'm not.",Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it!",Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson!",Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.",Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," No, it has to be the two of us.",Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty, Why? Why do you need me?,Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home.",Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty, Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!,Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Good,  'cuz we're here! ",Barney
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty,"  I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like?",Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty, Freedom... No actually it tasted like pennies.,Ted
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," We really did and that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney. I never got where I thought I wanted to go, but I always got a great story.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,3, Sweet Taste of Liberty," Kids, every story in a man's life is like a dot in an impressionist's painting. And when you...",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding," When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding, Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Ted, it's a simile.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," The big unanswered question in my life. Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding," Pft, Derek.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding," Well, Derek and I just broke up.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," No, that's terrible, are you OK?",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Yeah, do you need a drink or something?",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Robin was into me when we first met. Fact.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Ah, here we go.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, What?,Barney
1,12, The Wedding, We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, I thought so.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, A little girl?,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, What up?,Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Yes, but I'm the bride so I win.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Well, makes sense.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Lily, I need a dress.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress?",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," I know, it's a suicide mission.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Bye babe.,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Invigorating, thanks.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," OK, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys but back then I really thought that's how it worked.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding, You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting. The stars line up and shazam.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding, I know now that life is never that simple.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding," Hey, Claudia!",Ted
1,12, The Wedding,"  Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla. You wrote it down wrong? No no no no no, listen to me. If I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian vanilla, I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground. Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding? Good-bye.",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," You should be, lots of single girls.",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, You're not bringing a date.,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," Uh, yes I am.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Uh, no you're not.",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, I checked 'plus one'.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, No you didn't.,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding.",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, But I already invited someone.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months!",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it?",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes?",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Don't make me hurt you Ted.,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," But to be fair, she's also hot.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Yeah, right.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding, I did.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," A little Barney. And you know what he said?  ""Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.""",Barney
1,12, The Wedding, Wow.,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, Then what am I gonna do?,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come.,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding,  Just a second.,Robin
1,12, The Wedding, Hey.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Hey, listen.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Lily's there's a problem.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Go.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?",Robin
1,12, The Wedding, I think I brought it.,Robin
1,12, The Wedding, Wow.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.,Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Yeah, about that.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," So, the dress?",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, What?,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Why didn't you check 'plus...,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I did check 'plus one'.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, But Robin is so excited.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I know.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, And the dress.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I know.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, I wish we were ninjas.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I know.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, You can always ask Stuart.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Can I do that?,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Yeah, she's not usually like that.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Like you could possibly know that.,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Nice.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, What? How?,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, I talked to Stuart.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, you went around the bride. ""Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight."" Did you known about this?",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, It may have been my idea.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, What? Stuart doesn't get a say.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, So I can invite whoever I want.,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, It's Claudia.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," So, it begins.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Come on, it can't be that bad.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Here, Lily, you answer it.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, What? Why?,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, But...but you're the guy...oh.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What?",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Now I wasn't there, but what I heard, it went something like this.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,12, The Wedding, You what?,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, Always undermining me at every turn.,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," And your mother, calling me all the time...",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, They broke up.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Ow!,Ted
1,12, The Wedding,"  Uh-huh, uh-huh.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," It's not because of me, is it?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Uh-huh.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill Ted, then I'm gonna kill Ted.",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, It's Robin.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Answer it.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Uh, Lily's phone.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.,Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Uh, Lily's busy.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Bye-bye.,Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Ted, focus.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?",Lily

1,12, The Wedding, I feel terrible.,Ted

1,12, The Wedding, Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries.",Barney

1,12, The Wedding,  They all drink vodka cranberries.,Barney
1,12, The Wedding," So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," You got $400,000?",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," No, but I do have a hug.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding,  Thank you.,Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Dude, who doesn't.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Stuart, don't get married.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, Dude.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," You know I don't have $400,000, right?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.",Barney

1,12, The Wedding," Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, hell no.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, Oww,Barney
1,12, The Wedding," Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.",Lily
1,12, The Wedding," All right, all right.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding, Stuart. I'm so sorry.,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, I love you.,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, Marshall said what?,Claudia
1,12, The Wedding," So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Still wow.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.,Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Sorry.,Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.",Robin

1,12, The Wedding," Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, Did we just start planning our wedding?,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I think we did.,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding, We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.,Lily
1,12, The Wedding," Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome.",Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," My God, were you born without taste buds? ",Lily
1,12, The Wedding, What?,Lily
1,12, The Wedding, I love you.,Marshall
1,12, The Wedding," Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.",Robin
1,12, The Wedding," Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding, What's a sixteen?,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.,Barney
1,12, The Wedding, Hi Ted.,Claudia

1,12, The Wedding, Um  She couldn't make it.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.",Ted
1,12, The Wedding," Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," By the way, I almost forgot. We found this.",Claudia
1,12, The Wedding, I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Being single's the best.,Barney
1,12, The Wedding, Stay out as late as you want.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Answer to no one.,Barney
1,12, The Wedding, The whole world full of endless possibilities.,Ted
1,12, The Wedding, Never having to go to a farmer's market.,Barney
1,12, The Wedding," OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...",Barney
1,12, The Wedding," So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," They have to come out soon, it's Monday.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Maybe they're not even in there.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Good morning.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Hey, guys.",Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I'm just going to ignore that.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Thank you!,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I wish you could stay.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.",Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Call you afterwards?,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Bye.,Ted

1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Zero.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What?,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What?,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.",Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Her idea.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.",Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You've only had s*x with one girl in your whole life.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Burn!,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.",Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," It's one of New York Magazine's ""Top five romantic getaways on a budget."" Who says sexual can't be sensible?",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Really?,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Actually, I was talking to my martini.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Ready to go?,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", And it's supposed to rain tonight.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Or we could just stay home.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Maybe watch some TV.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Order in some Chinese.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Hell, yeah.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Good, cause this thing's empty.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow.""",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You can't just... Wow!,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", So... one more week and it'll be a month.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.",Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, come on.",Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", The 18th can't get here fast enough.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!",Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.",Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", 75th and Amsterdam.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", And yet we'd feel obligated to have s*x.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, my God, what are they doing home?",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", But I don't want to hide out in here.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You suited up!,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Emilio? The woman will have...,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide.""",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Father issues. Hot.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What up! Freeze frame high five!,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", And they're not even high.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", It's actually working.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, try five.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What up! Maybe we should just go out there.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?",Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", He's just staring into her eyes.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, ""Want to do it?"" And I say, ""Yeah.""",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Want to...,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Looks like they're about to have theirs.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Should we take this to the bedroom?,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yes!,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yes!,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yes.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yes!,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yes!,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," No. No, don't answer it!",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You can answer it. We have all night.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You're answering it? He's answering it!,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", No! Do her! Do her now!,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Sure. Good luck with that.  Sorry about that.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", How about a little more wine?,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I'll get another bottle.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Shh...,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", But I...,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", See you on the other side.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yeah.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", All right.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", It's all right. We can do this.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Let's just hold hands. This is nice.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, we can't.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What is it?,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I have to pee.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", This is bad.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Yeah.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", How much longer do you think you can hold it?,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, boy.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Neither have I. Of course I cheat.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", That's a woman.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Let's just focus on your target.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Right.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...,Woman
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.,Woman
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", We'll see about that.,Woman
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, you have farted in front of me.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You always do.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Hey.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Hey.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What happened?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", But why?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Hit!,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Ted, I can't wait any longer.",Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Should we move to the bedroom?,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", There's no time for that.,Victoria
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I know.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I love you, Marshall.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I love you, Lily.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Hard-core? That's the only way I play. ,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", No.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I'm okay. You okay?,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", They must have heard that.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I checked with Ted.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Sure. Good luck with that.,Ted
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Totally gave us his blessing.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Really?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Really.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", What?,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You like Ted.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", I didn't say I liked Ted.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," You're not gonna tell him, are you?",Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", A-7.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Miss.,Barney
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Of course.,Robin
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", Not making me feel better.,Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Well, it certainly was a first.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Marshall, what makes you cry?",Lily
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip", This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.,Marshall
1,14," Zip, Zip, Zip"," Oh, just grab my boob already.",Lily
1,15, Game Night," You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win.",Ted
1,15, Game Night, I know. It's just fun to say.,Marshall
1,15, Game Night," We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, ""invent your own game.""",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,15, Game Night," It's called ""Marsh-gammon."" It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Backgammon, obviously.",Robin
1,15, Game Night," No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the ""gammon,"" and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night, I'm so excited Victoria's coming.,Lily
1,15, Game Night, I'm going to go get another round.,Robin
1,15, Game Night," Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",Ted
1,15, Game Night," Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",Barney
1,15, Game Night, No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.,Ted
1,15, Game Night," Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",Lily
1,15, Game Night," Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",Ted
1,15, Game Night, Us? What would we do?,Lily
1,15, Game Night," Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",Ted
1,15, Game Night, Fine.,Marshall
1,15, Game Night, Fine.,Lily
1,15, Game Night, Thank you.,Ted
1,15, Game Night, I should go help Robin.,Lily
1,15, Game Night, Hey.,Robin
1,15, Game Night," Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",Lily
1,15, Game Night," Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, ""She's great"" too many times, didn't I?",Robin
1,15, Game Night, You must really hate the bitch.,Lily
1,15, Game Night," But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you ""Marshall out,"" and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question ""What?"", then... you got to drink. Got it?",Marshall
1,15, Game Night, No,All
1,15, Game Night," Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night, Okay.,Victoria
1,15, Game Night," Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Marshall, come on.",Ted
1,15, Game Night," Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, ""Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"" Wow, good question.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night, You don't have to answer that.,Ted
1,15, Game Night," It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.",Victoria
1,15, Game Night," Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night," So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?",Barney
1,15, Game Night, What?,Victoria
1,15, Game Night," You said what, you got to drink!",Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?",Lily

1,15, Game Night," Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...",Lily

1,15, Game Night," Oh, slut alert!",Robin
1,15, Game Night," Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.",Barney
1,15, Game Night, Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.,Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Barney, what was on that tape?",Lily
1,15, Game Night, Too bad you'll never find out.,Barney
1,15, Game Night," Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.",Lily
1,15, Game Night, What?!,Barney
1,15, Game Night, Drink!,Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?",Lily

1,15, Game Night," Play the tape, play it, play it!",Ted
1,15, Game Night," Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...",Barney
1,15, Game Night, Did you try his cell phone?,Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.",Ted
1,15, Game Night," Hey, guys, what up?",Barney
1,15, Game Night," Barney, where have you been?",Robin
1,15, Game Night," Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.",Ted
1,15, Game Night," Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay.",Lily
1,15, Game Night, Come on. Stay!,All
1,15, Game Night," I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.",Barney
1,15, Game Night," Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.",Barney
1,15, Game Night, All right.,Marshall
1,15, Game Night," I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.",Marshall
1,15, Game Night, The kids still call him Funny Butt.,Lily

1,15, Game Night," Shannon, there is no...",Barney

1,15, Game Night, Now we all got to drink.,Marshall
1,15, Game Night," Oh, my God. What happened next?",Ted
1,15, Game Night," I don't know, guys.",Barney

1,15, Game Night, So we've got the whole place to ourselves.,Marshall

1,15, Game Night," Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made.",Lily
1,15, Game Night, The whole time?,Robin
1,15, Game Night, The... whole... time.,Lily

1,15, Game Night," Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?",Barney
1,15, Game Night," You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",Ted
1,15, Game Night, We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.,Ted
1,15, Game Night, To one hell of a night!,Ranjit

1,15, Game Night," Victoria, I know this must be...",Ted
1,15, Game Night, Yeah. It kind of is.,Victoria

1,15, Game Night, Hi.,Barney
1,15, Game Night," Hi, Shannon.",Barney
1,15, Game Night," Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",Barney
1,15, Game Night," Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.",Lily
1,15, Game Night," My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",Barney
1,15, Game Night, Nope.,Lily
1,15, Game Night, Yeah.,Barney
1,15, Game Night, Nope.,Lily
1,15, Game Night, Yeah.,Barney
1,15, Game Night," Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.",Lily
1,15, Game Night," Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",Barney
1,15, Game Night," Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",Barney
1,15, Game Night," Ew, gross. Just stop it.",Lily
1,15, Game Night," Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!",Barney
1,15, Game Night, I think Barney just won game night.,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,16, Cupcake, My first solo batch.,Ted

1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,16, Cupcake," Um, are you coloring in your butt?",Barney

1,16, Cupcake, So wear another one.,Barney
1,16, Cupcake, I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake," Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake," A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks ""suit."" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake," No thanks, dude.  Noon?",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, Noon. See you then.,Barney
1,16, Cupcake," Hey, girls.",Victoria

1,16, Cupcake," Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Really? That'd be great.,Lily
1,16, Cupcake, Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",Lily
1,16, Cupcake, The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.,Robin
1,16, Cupcake," Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?",Lily
1,16, Cupcake, I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Wait. Germany, Europe?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," So, this is the Europe Germany?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, What other Germany would it be?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, The one in Epcot?,Ted

1,16, Cupcake, Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," So, that leaves us with...",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, I have to leave on Monday.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Monday, September the...?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Ted. Do you have any thoughts?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, It's a date.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, And that's when things got complicated.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,16, Cupcake," Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Well, good luck, baby.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake, You speak Ukrainian?,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. Kill me now.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.,Barney
1,16, Cupcake, Really? You?,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake," Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, Yeah.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Are you sure?,Barney
1,16, Cupcake, All right. ,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Hello.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.  She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake," Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, Here. Play with this pin cushion.,Barney
1,16, Cupcake, God. I'm going to look hot.,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake, No way. The Kid does not sell out.,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake, No. I've made my decision.,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,16, Cupcake," All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, I want you to stay.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, good luck, baby.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake, Bye.,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?",Woman
1,16, Cupcake, Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,Lily
1,16, Cupcake, I saw a couple up front that were nice.,Robin
1,16, Cupcake, Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,Lily
1,16, Cupcake, At least we get free champagne!,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, And cake.,Robin
1,16, Cupcake, Mm-hmm.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Ugh. All talking and no s*x. Kill me now.,Lily
1,16, Cupcake," I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake, But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake, I really don't...,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake, Thanks.,Woman
1,16, Cupcake," It's okay, guys, I hate it.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake, Just horrible.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake, But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,Robin
1,16, Cupcake, Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Maybe he's going to buy you one.,Lily
1,16, Cupcake, I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,Robin
1,16, Cupcake, That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Ugly, ugly, ugly.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Are you okay?,Lily
1,16, Cupcake, I'm fine.,Robin
1,16, Cupcake, Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,Lily
1,16, Cupcake," I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Somebody say ""beautiful princess.""",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, I know what you mean.,Robin
1,16, Cupcake, You do?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," See, that's what I'm afraid of.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,Robin
1,16, Cupcake, Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," No, you are.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Okay, I am.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake, I'm going to stay.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Wow, you look incredible.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married.  Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake, It was like this when I found it?,Lily
1,16, Cupcake, And how will you be paying for this?,Woman
1,16, Cupcake, Credit card... s.,Lily
1,16, Cupcake," I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, I want you to stay.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, I have to go to Germany.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, You're going?,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Yes. I have to.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, So that's what you decided?,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," What is this, opposite day or something?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, No.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, So it is?,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Well, that's just crazy.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, You'd have me.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, So... we're breaking up?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, I guess so. I guess so.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, She's leaving tomorrow.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, but she's still in town.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, she... she's still in town.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Awesome air kicks, huh?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, New pajama bottoms?,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, You know it.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Wait, so we're sharing the leg?",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," No, the leg is a metaphor.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Well, what would you want to do?",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Like go to the Mets.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, See some monkeys at the zoo?,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Wow! We better get going.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, big day.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Yeah.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,16, Cupcake," Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",Robin
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, but only, like, second base.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake," Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",Barney
1,16, Cupcake," Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake," B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",Barney
1,16, Cupcake, You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, I most certainly did...,Barney
1,16, Cupcake," Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",Marshall
1,16, Cupcake," I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.",Lily
1,16, Cupcake, What time is the interview?,Marshall
1,16, Cupcake, I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, I'm going to miss you so much.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," I'm going to miss you, too.",Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, Even if we're not.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Okay.,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake," Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?",Ted
1,16, Cupcake, Yes. Yes!,Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, We can beat the odds.,Ted
1,16, Cupcake," Odds, schmodds.",Victoria
1,16, Cupcake, It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old, he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas. It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?,Marshall

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, So you don't want coffee.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, All right. I'm pouring it out.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. ""The kid"" has become ""the man.""",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming.",Marshall

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I love you.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I love you too, Marshmallow.",Ted

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Yeah. Yeah, she did.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Another care package?,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Another care package. I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month. Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, How many is that so far?,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Three.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, And how many have you sent her?,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," God, that is so me at 15.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Go for Barney.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, A sasquatch?,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.,Barney

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Sure you don't want one?,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, How many of those have you eaten?,Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem.",Ted

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, That is funny.,Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, And here's why it was funny.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier, here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," The irony is clear, Ted.",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Hey! How was your first day?,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, What?,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, They're jerks!,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, What makes them jerks?,Lily

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?",Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," For your information, my fiancee did.",Marshall

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I quit.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Please.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, What?,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, The package?,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Lily doesn't care about that stuff.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, She'll be happy.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.,Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I guess, uh... Bea Arthur.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Ahh! Wrong! Betty White. Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.",Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," So, did she get the awesome care package yet?",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Yep. Yesterday.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Did she love it?,Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Ooh, she loved it.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, So what's the problem?,Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, It's pretty clear.,Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I have to go to Germany and surprise her.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Marshall, consider the penguins.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, The penguins?,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, On the wall.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," ""Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."" This is a motivational poster?",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, It sounds kinda like peer pressure.,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Only when I'm drunk.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Good boy.,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I'm psyched!,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Wow, that was really specific.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, So badly.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Right. Get what done?,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Whatever.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Cool. And what guy is this?,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, There's always a guy.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, ""Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."" So I'm, like, ""Snapadoo!"" So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Great story.,Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Uh-oh.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I'd wait.,Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," 'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Okay...what do you think?,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Steak sauce.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Steak sauce?,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Yeah.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Why?,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Okay.,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week. Yeah.",Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, You're right. They're delightful.,Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Nah. I'm so over karaoke.,Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.",Barney
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart.""",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, What?,Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart."" Elton John, Kiki Dee.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.,Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," ""Iron Man."" I could do ""Iron Man.""",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Steak sauce, dude.",Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, That's my man!,Bilson
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package.",Lily
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Hello.,Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Why hasn't she called yet?,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",Robin
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.",Robin

1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, I think Victoria's about to break up with me.,Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.",Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas," I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?",Ted
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, *Don't go breakin' my heart*,Marshall
1,17, Life Among the Gorillas, *I couldn't if I tried*,Lily

1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?",Barney
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., And it begins.,Barney
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Wow. Weird.,Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., I'll be here.,Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Hello?,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Sorry about that.,Marshall
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Was that Korean Elvis?,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.",Marshall
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",Marshall
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Gonna?,Lily
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Yes. First thing tomorrow.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., I hate how you're always right.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., It's my best and most annoying trait.,Lily
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Hey.,Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.",Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Can I call you tomorrow?,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.,Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Okay. Good night, Robin.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Good night, Ted.",Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Oh, my God. We're making out.",Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Right.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., This is crazy.,Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Right? Right?,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...",Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Yeah.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Yeah?,Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Okay.,Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Stop doing that.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Whatcha doin'?,Victoria
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...",Victoria
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.,Victoria
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., It's not ideal.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?",Barney
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., I think he just spat on me.,Lily
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",Marshall
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," No! No, come on.",Barney
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Yes!,Marshall
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the ""le"". We still got the ""gen."" The ""da."" The ""ry.""",Barney
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Okay, if we're at the ""le,"" then I say we follow it up with a ""t's go home.""",Lily
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.",Marshall
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Okay, seriously.",Lily
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?",Marshall
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Good. So you're gonna go home?,Victoria
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Ted.,Victoria
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Oh, please. You just want to get laid.",Victoria
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., That's not your phone.,Victoria
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., This isn't my phone.,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.," Okay. Bye.  I thought it was mine, so I answered it.",Robin
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., Was it...?,Ted
1,18, Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M., It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
2,3, Brunch," Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, I hate you.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I hate you more.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, I'm going to kill him.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, I can't say I blame you.,Barney
2,3, Brunch," No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
2,3, Brunch, Not now.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Robin...! ,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch," Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?,Ted
2,3, Brunch, Coffee?,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch," Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Good to see you.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.,Lily
2,3, Brunch," Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well...",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I love your hair.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch," Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch, What?,Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.",Lily
2,3, Brunch, Why would it?,Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch," ""Brother and sister""?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. ",Lily
2,3, Brunch, See? Not awkward at all.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch," Hello, everyone.",Lily
2,3, Brunch, Hi.,All
2,3, Brunch," Hello, Marshall.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Lily, that is a stunning dress.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, ""Hey, we're all family."" Right, bro? Ooh, ah...",Lily
2,3, Brunch, What's wrong?,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just...  Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch, That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.,Barney
2,3, Brunch," Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch, I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.,Barney
2,3, Brunch, So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch, Hello.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Oh, hi.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," Hey, Marshall.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, Hey.,Robin
2,3, Brunch, Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.,Lily
2,3, Brunch," Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?",Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of...  What are you doing?",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable.  Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch, Take off your dress.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, Take off the rest of your pants.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I really wasn't expecting that to happen.,Lily
2,3, Brunch," Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?",Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.",Lily
2,3, Brunch, Seduce you? You seduced me.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, You went to San Francisco for three months.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, How is that seducing you?,Lily
2,3, Brunch," Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch," All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch, You are evil.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I'm going to kill him.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, I can't say I blame you.,Barney
2,3, Brunch," No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch," Barney, what are you doing here?",Ted
2,3, Brunch, Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.,Barney
2,3, Brunch, I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, What?,Barney
2,3, Brunch, But I'm your best friend.,Barney
2,3, Brunch," Well, actually Marshall's my...",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I'm the most important person in your life.,Barney
2,3, Brunch," Well, Robin's actually...",Ted
2,3, Brunch, How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.,Barney
2,3, Brunch," To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.",Robin
2,3, Brunch," Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, Ted.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, I know you've all been excited to meet...,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint ""Bless This Mess"" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? ",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, Hello.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Hello.,Robin
2,3, Brunch," Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, A real looker.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, I love salmon risotto.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, I know.,Barney
2,3, Brunch, How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.,Robin
2,3, Brunch," Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Stop it! Don't, don't!",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?",Barney
2,3, Brunch," What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.",Robin
2,3, Brunch," Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!",Barney
2,3, Brunch, Can I help?,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Well, funny you should ask...",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.",Marshall
2,3, Brunch, Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?,Barney
2,3, Brunch," No, I'm kind of tired.",Robin
2,3, Brunch," Me, too.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Cervezas? Did he fall?,Ted
2,3, Brunch," I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?,Ted
2,3, Brunch, I'll save you a seat.,Barney
2,3, Brunch," Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Robin.,Robin
2,3, Brunch," Susan, her name is Virginia.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.",Barney
2,3, Brunch, Why?,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?",Barney
2,3, Brunch, Wow. You're like a hero.,Girl
2,3, Brunch," Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," You poor, brave man.",Girl
2,3, Brunch, Why don't you give the guy a hug?,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, I'm... oh. .,Barney
2,3, Brunch," My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?",Ted
2,3, Brunch," I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.",Barney
2,3, Brunch, Sure.,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?,Barney
2,3, Brunch," My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""?",Ted
2,3, Brunch," You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.",Barney
2,3, Brunch, That's not a real Web site.,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.",Barney
2,3, Brunch," Hi, Dad.",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Hey, Ted. Barney!",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Enjoying your vacation so far?,Ted

2,3, Brunch," Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Yeah. So...,Ted
2,3, Brunch, What?,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Well...,Ted
2,3, Brunch, Well what?,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?,Ted
2,3, Brunch," I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.",Barney
2,3, Brunch, I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
2,3, Brunch, Not now.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Robin...! ,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and Robin part of the story.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch, We were expecting my parents at any minute.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,3, Brunch, One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, But this is the first time she's meeting me.,Robin
2,3, Brunch, But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?,Robin
2,3, Brunch, You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, I'm gonna lie.,Robin
2,3, Brunch, I would.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I know how important it is to you.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day. Stacy's pregnant again.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Oh, good for her.",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Oh, boy.",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Tell us what it's like being a journalist.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, I'm just not ready.,Robin
2,3, Brunch, Okay. No pressure.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great.",Robin
2,3, Brunch," Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Ooh, a piano!",Barney
2,3, Brunch," You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Hooray?,Ted
2,3, Brunch," I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.",Robin
2,3, Brunch," Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, What happened to Marshall and Lily?,Barney
2,3, Brunch, They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, More coffee?,Wendy
2,3, Brunch," Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet?",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Excuse me?,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Nothing. ,Robin
2,3, Brunch, Just a minute.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, Maybe less.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you?",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?,Robin
2,3, Brunch, Do you want to have my grandkids?,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Marshall, your zipper.",Lily
2,3, Brunch," Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?",Robin
2,3, Brunch," Well... Okay, there's something you don't know...",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Smile!,Wendy
2,3, Brunch, I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, I'm gonna kill him.,Ted
2,3, Brunch," I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Not now.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
2,3, Brunch, Robin...! ,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy!  I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad.",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Ted, what are you talking about?",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?",Ted
2,3, Brunch, Okay. I hooked up with a waitress.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Oh.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Oh?,Ted
2,3, Brunch," I mean, oh! Oh! Ooh! We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al. Oh, ooh!",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?",Ted

2,3, Brunch," Closer to ten, I think.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Time flies.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?",Ted
2,3, Brunch," No, it wasn't a snap decision.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, We'd been separated almost two years.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, How could you not tell me this?!,Ted
2,3, Brunch," We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, So last Christmas...?,Ted
2,3, Brunch," We talked about telling you kids then, but it didn't seem very Christmasy.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, I got you a tandem bike.,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Who the hell is Frank?!,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. ",Ted
2,3, Brunch," Teddy bear, oh...",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.",Barney
2,3, Brunch, Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch," Me, too.",Lily
2,3, Brunch, I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.,Lily
2,3, Brunch," Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?",Marshall
2,3, Brunch, Did you Mystic Tan your calves?,Lily
2,3, Brunch, I withdraw the question.,Marshall
2,3, Brunch, It was wrong not to tell you.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Thank you.,Ted
2,3, Brunch," But listen, don't tell your sister.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, It would just upset her.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, Indians won today on a walk-off double.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I never told you how I met your mother?,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, No.,Ted
2,3, Brunch," Oh, great story. At a bar.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I think it was an Irish bar.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",Ted
2,3, Brunch, We just realized we're very different people.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.,Ted
2,3, Brunch," On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.",Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, But we love Robin.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch," Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, We'll see you inside.,Ted's mother
2,3, Brunch, Sorry.,Ted's father
2,3, Brunch, Wow.,Robin
2,3, Brunch, I know.,Ted
2,3, Brunch, They love me!,Robin
2,3, Brunch," From now on, full disclosure.",Ted's father
2,3, Brunch," Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.",Ted
2,3, Brunch, I'm gonna get some juice.,Ted's mother
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, we just had our first fight.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, We had our first fight.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, no, what'd you fight about? .",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," And if we don't get it, we could go under.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Yes.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Wow, so it's the whole package.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, you did.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Had to.,Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, you did.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Had to.,Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, you did.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, That wasn't one.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Hey.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Hey.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, How was your day?,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Good.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Robin!,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You should work at a suicide hotline.,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, And then it got ugly.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, How do you not like Field of Dreams?!,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, I guess I don't know how to do that.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," What the hell comes before ""Q""?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Your job's not boring.,Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Robin thinks so.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, I love it when you quote Scripture.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," That's 'cause you're always like...  ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like...  ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yes, she did.",Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Mm-hmm.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," No. Hey, Lily. You still single?",Carl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Yes.,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.,Carl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Only if you're into it. It's on me.,Carl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Thanks.,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, I wonder where Ted went.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," All right, we'll swing by the party.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however...",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, I know you would. It's the job.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, That's our Attorney General.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yes, that's the young lady.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing?",Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Yay!,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Wait, let me just check with my friend.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Okay.,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Um... only always.,Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Let's go.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Hello.,Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Uh, okay. Bye.  Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, So these guys... One of them's an architect.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, That's the one.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, I live across the street.,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, That is one hell of a non sequitur.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You want to come over?,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. ",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Nice. Giddy up!,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Galloping.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," You proved it, all right? The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" things works.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Architects rule! Whoo-hee!,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, It is tonight. Whoo!,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You know this girl. Where does she live?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, I'm out of money.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I'm cashed, too.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, My purse?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Okay, fine.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Yeah... And steal her purse.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," 3-C, let's do this. You ready?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Should I just kick the door in?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, I'm the problem.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, What?,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Let's do this.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Bring it. ,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, What do you think you're...? Barney?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Ted? He's at work.,Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, How did you get here?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Awesome story. As per usual.,Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yes, she did.",Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.,Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, stay ",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Excuse us for one second.  Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, you did.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yeah, had to. See ya. ",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.",Girl
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Ted Mosby... Architect.,Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Galloping.,Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," All right, you proved it. The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" thing works.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, It is tonight.,Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, But why would you use Ted's name?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, This is how people act in relationships.,Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, And that's why I avoid relationships.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",Lily
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a ""A."" A... A... I'll just put ""resident."" Go, go, go, go.",Barney
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Hey.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Hey. What are you doing here?,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Obviously. Wow.,Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Yes.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?",Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Wow. Ted, this is amazing.",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect, Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.,Ted
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. ",Robin
2,4, Ted Mosby: Architect," Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. ",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Aaaaaaah!,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Welcome to my new home.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Or a stove in your bathroom?,Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason.,Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hold on, I got it.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," That was ""something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Uh. Other cultures!,Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...?  Aaaaaah!",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.",Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.",Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, The fortress of barnitude? No way.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Come on. She's desperate.,Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Absolutely not.,Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, No.,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch!",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh, you don't think I've tried?",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Table for one.,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Um, no, just me.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, You're right. Who am I kidding?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?",Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Of course, sweetie.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Can I go with you guys?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Really? For brunch?,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," God, I hate being single!",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Ted gave me your spare key.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Spare key! Brilliant!,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," That's terrible. Well, see ya.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Wait, can I stay here maybe?",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I'd let you, but I don't have any room.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a s*x visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Wow, you really are desperate.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I really am.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, It hurts my eyes.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Yeah. That doesn't go away.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hey, where have you been?",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, The Alanis Morissette concert.,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, By yourself?,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," No,actually I went with a friend from law school.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh,really? Who's this friend?",Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Brad.,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!",Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Yeah, how'd you know?",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I just got dumped myself.,Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, You invited him to brunch?,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Yes. That's why I was all ""you invited him to brunch?""",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Because brunch is kind of...,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Girly.,Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Uhm, smells delicious.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...  What are you doing?",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Lily, what was the first rule again?",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," ""Don't change anything""?",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, And what was the second rule?,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, There was no second rule.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Marshall doesn't have p0rn.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," God, I love brunch.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous.",Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," This isn't weird, right?",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny.",Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Right? Right?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?",Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, This must be destiny.,Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, What are you talking about?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I have two tickets for Mamma Mia! friday night. You like Abba, right? What am I saying?Who doesn't? Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me. We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say?",Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Yeah!,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Hey. Did the cold wake you?,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," No,I've just been watching you sleep.",Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.,Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day.",Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look  Oh, I'm disgusting.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you.",Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um...",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?,Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, What? No. Yes!,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Yes?,Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Yes.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.,Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?  You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p0rn.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Thank you.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I'll do it.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Really?,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I'll take it.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Mamma mia!?,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Ooh, third date. You know what that means.",Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, You bros going to get dinner beforehand?,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," We might grab a steak, yeah.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Where at?,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Café l'amour.  Brad says the food is really good there, okay?",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your ""A"" game. That means no granny panties.",Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, What are you going to wear?,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...  Oh, you know what? Shut up.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Can you pass the arts and leisure?  Can you pass the arts and leisure?,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I just did.,Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Lily, I can explain...",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, How could you? In our own home?  You b*st*rd!,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...,Girl
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I...  I was just about to turn on the tears.,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," You know... Oh nah, never mind.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, What did you have in mind?,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh, you really don't have to do that.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," No, I insist. You're my guest.",Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Thanks, Brad.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. ,Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Woah!,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.",Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, It gets worse.,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come?",Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, You want me to go to a wedding with you?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers"".",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.,Robin
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, It gets worse.,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.,Brad
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Vermont?,Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro.",Brad

2,5, World's Greatest Couple, I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.",Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.",Marshall
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Good man.,Ted
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.",Lily

2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hey,it takes two to cuddle.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, That's what you think a relationship is?,Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.",Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.",Lily
2,5, World's Greatest Couple, Uh-uh. You gotta go.,Barney
2,5, World's Greatest Couple," Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.",Lily

2,6, Aldrin Justice," In fact, she found it again and again.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,Lily

2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, No.,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Here she comes. Here she comes.,Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I'm sorry.,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What do you want?,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, No.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Robin, nothing to add?",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Thank you.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Really? Laid, you say?",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice, She hot?,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice, And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, A what?,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice," A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",Barney

2,6, Aldrin Justice," Dude, that is cold-blooded.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What would I be doing?,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, right, is that the...?",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Yeah. Here's the model.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I know.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, And the way it...,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I know.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, And the two little...,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I know.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, It is just...,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Ah.,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Nice to meet you.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I, uh... I am an architect.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Absolutely.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, So you're going to design the...,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Styrofoam trees.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Once again, with feeling.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Styrofoam trees.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Styrofoam trees!,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Styrofoam trees!,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? ",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Man, that guy is a total, well... ",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Did you show lily your design?,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, No.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What design?,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, It's nothing.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough!",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, my god. Incredible.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Okay, I'm done.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Great. Thanks.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Too green.,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Too green?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I can't un-picture it.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What? What's gone?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? ",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Hey.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, That's easy. I took it.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Why?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, It's simple.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What does his ball have to do with anything?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Hey, guys. What's going on?",Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Why? Was he being mean?,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, You know about this?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I gave them to you for your birthday.,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, So is being mean.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Well, that's why I left a note.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, A note?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I know, I know.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I think I'm falling in love with you.,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, No.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," What do you mean, no?",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Everybody get in here now!,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," ""Who wants espresso?""",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Interesting.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Then you're fired.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, So you're going back over there?,Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Lily was mentally deranged.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Lily was mentally deranged!,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, The clients are here.,Man
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Excellent. Bring them in.,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Wait! We have one more idea for you.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Ted, what are you doing?",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, I have another design.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Sit down, shut up right now.",Mr Druthers
2,6, Aldrin Justice, No.,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice, To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, Probably!,All
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Congrats, ted.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",Lily
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Barney! Oh, my god!",Robin
2,6, Aldrin Justice, What happened?,Ted
2,6, Aldrin Justice," That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Professor Lewis, hi.",Marshall
2,6, Aldrin Justice," Yeah, she was.",Barney
2,6, Aldrin Justice," B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!",Barney
2,7, Swarley, It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,Lily
2,7, Swarley, And she did find it.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,7, Swarley," In fact, she found it again and again.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,7, Swarley, I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,Lily
2,7, Swarley, What is she doing for money through all this?,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",Robin
2,7, Swarley," Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",Ted
2,7, Swarley, No.,Robin
2,7, Swarley, Here she comes. Here she comes.,Marshall
2,7, Swarley," Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",Lily
2,7, Swarley, I'm sorry.,Robin
2,7, Swarley," Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .",Barney
2,7, Swarley, What do you want?,Lily
2,7, Swarley, I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",Lily
2,7, Swarley, I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,Barney
2,7, Swarley, No.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",Lily
2,7, Swarley," Robin, nothing to add?",Ted
2,7, Swarley, No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,Robin
2,7, Swarley, Thank you.,Lily
2,7, Swarley," Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",Robin
2,7, Swarley, I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,Marshall
2,7, Swarley," I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""",Ted
2,7, Swarley," Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",Marshall
2,7, Swarley," Really? Laid, you say?",Barney
2,7, Swarley," You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",Marshall
2,7, Swarley, She hot?,Barney
2,7, Swarley," Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",Marshall
2,7, Swarley, And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,Barney
2,7, Swarley, A what?,Robin
2,7, Swarley," A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",Barney
2,7, Swarley, What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",Barney
2,7, Swarley, I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...,Marshall
2,7, Swarley," Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",Barney
2,7, Swarley, Classic.,Marshall
2,7, Swarley," Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",Robin
2,7, Swarley, Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," So, where should we eat today?  Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? ",Ted
2,7, Swarley," Dude, that is cold-blooded.",Marshall
2,7, Swarley," It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",Ted
2,7, Swarley," Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",Robin
2,7, Swarley, It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",Barney
2,7, Swarley," So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",Ted
2,7, Swarley, What would I be doing?,Lily
2,7, Swarley," Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",Ted
2,7, Swarley, You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Oh, right, is that the...?",Lily
2,7, Swarley, Yeah. Here's the model.,Ted
2,7, Swarley, You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,Lily
2,7, Swarley," I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",Ted
2,7, Swarley, How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,Lily
2,7, Swarley, I know.,Ted
2,7, Swarley, And the way it...,Lily
2,7, Swarley, I know.,Ted
2,7, Swarley, And the two little...,Lily
2,7, Swarley, I know.,Ted
2,7, Swarley, It is just...,Lily
2,7, Swarley," Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",Ted
2,7, Swarley, Ah.,Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, Nice to meet you.,Lily
2,7, Swarley," Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",Mr Druthers

2,7, Swarley," That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? ",Mr Druthers

2,7, Swarley," Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",Barney
2,7, Swarley," Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",Marshall
2,7, Swarley," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",Barney
2,7, Swarley, I think I'm falling in love with you.,Barney
2,7, Swarley, What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,Barney
2,7, Swarley," When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",Ted
2,7, Swarley, No.,Lily
2,7, Swarley," What do you mean, no?",Ted
2,7, Swarley," I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",Lily
2,7, Swarley," Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",Ted
2,7, Swarley, Everybody get in here now!,Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley," ""Who wants espresso?""",Lily
2,7, Swarley," Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, Interesting.,Lily
2,7, Swarley," Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley," Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",Lily
2,7, Swarley, Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",Lily
2,7, Swarley," This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",Ted
2,7, Swarley," All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",Lily
2,7, Swarley, No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",Lily
2,7, Swarley, Then you're fired.,Ted
2,7, Swarley, Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,Lily
2,7, Swarley," Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Marshall
2,7, Swarley, Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,Barney
2,7, Swarley, So you're going back over there?,Marshall
2,7, Swarley," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",Barney
2,7, Swarley, I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,Barney
2,7, Swarley," But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",Barney
2,7, Swarley," Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley," Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",Ted
2,7, Swarley," Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, Lily was mentally deranged.,Ted
2,7, Swarley, You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, Lily was mentally deranged!,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, The clients are here.,Man
2,7, Swarley, Excellent. Bring them in.,Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,7, Swarley," Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,7, Swarley, Wait! We have one more idea for you.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Ted, what are you doing?",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, I have another design.,Ted
2,7, Swarley," Sit down, shut up right now.",Mr Druthers
2,7, Swarley, No.,Ted
2,7, Swarley, To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,Robin
2,7, Swarley, Probably!,All
2,7, Swarley," Congrats, ted.",Lily
2,7, Swarley," Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",Ted
2,7, Swarley," Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",Lily
2,7, Swarley," Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",Ted
2,7, Swarley," No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",Lily
2,7, Swarley," Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",Lily
2,7, Swarley," Barney! Oh, my god!",Robin
2,7, Swarley, What happened?,Ted
2,7, Swarley," That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",Barney
2,7, Swarley," Professor Lewis, hi.",Marshall
2,7, Swarley," Yeah, she was.",Barney
2,7, Swarley," B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue, I got it. You ready? You ready?,Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Yeah.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," I love you, Mr. Awesome.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue," I love you, Mrs. Awesome.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, So...,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, So...,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Wedding's over.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Yes, it is.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Tell people what?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Hi, Barney.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Tell people what?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," The food looks delicious, doesn't it?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Tell people what?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Nothing.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, okay. Tell people what?",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Can we talk about this later?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Absolutely. Tell people what?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Hi. Have you met Barney?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Okay. ,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Whoo, that was a close one.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Think he'll actually let it go?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Can I get a water please?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Tell people what?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Fine.,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," It's pretty big, though.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, my God, just tell me!",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, help us.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue, What's wrong?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," All right, let's run some interference.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to...",Lily
2,22, Something Blue, And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.,Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," All right, let's get these two back to their table.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Conga line.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, yes, definitely.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue," How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" and ending with your baby photos side by side.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, that's great. Going on the list.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue, What list?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Horrible wedding clichées we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, How's it go?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," ""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things.""",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Lame.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Going on the list.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue, We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Well, okay, one clichée.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Well, technically two.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, No! They cleared our plates again!,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," Well, you still have me.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue, Yeah...,Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...",Lily
2,22, Something Blue, Are those mini quiches?  Tell the secret.,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Um, we didn't order champagne.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Wow. Thanks. Cheers.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away. So what was in the glass?",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow.""",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, You said that already!,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Is an engagement ring.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Don't get married.,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Why don't I come back.,Man
2,22, Something Blue," An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, That's what she said.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, What are you talking about?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, That's not mine.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, What?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, That's not mine.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Then whose is it?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, It's mine. Janna... will you marry me?,Man
2,22, Something Blue, Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, What the hell was that?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, What the hell was what?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, That reaction?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, I thought you were proposing to me.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Now more than ever.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, No.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Then why is this an issue?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no.""",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, No.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, So did you guys find anything to eat?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, I had four strawberries.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue, Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Lily, you could have burped or said the word ""Yes,"" but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, look, more strawberries!",Lily
2,22, Something Blue, So what happened next?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Ted, don't do this.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Where do you see yourself?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, And I probably want to be in Argentina.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Argentina?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," We have an expiration date, don't we?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Barney... story's not over.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Wha... what?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Run!,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Run? Your strategy was run?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Yeah? And how did that work out for you?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, So... Argentina.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Argentina.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, I could want to live in Argentina.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, shut up.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, You're scared I might not be kidding.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Aren't you?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Right? Right?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, You caught the bouquet?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Barney. The story's not over yet.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Wait, wait, wait, wait.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, What?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, I don't know if I can do this to you.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Do what?,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, You know what I mean.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Well, we probably shouldn't.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Yeah.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Risk it?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Risk it.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, No.,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake.",Man
2,22, Something Blue," No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Come on, they're cutting the cake.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clichée, remember?",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," No, it's going to be so funny.",Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry. ",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Whoopsy-daisy.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, We love you. I love you.,Lily
2,22, Something Blue," Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," God, this guy's giving me nothing.",Man
2,22, Something Blue," All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, ""What's up?""",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," Hey, kiddo.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," The story's not over, Barney.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Not a euphemism.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?",Robin
2,22, Something Blue," We're not doing this, are we?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, I don't want to have kids in Argentina.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, So where does that leave us?,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, You stole a blue French horn for me.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, You did break up.,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Yep.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, You're not pregnant?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Nope.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, You guys okay?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, But we're okay.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue, The open bar helps.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Hi.,Robin
2,22, Something Blue," Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you. Uh, driver.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Hello!,Ranjit
2,22, Something Blue," Ranjit!! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel?",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch.",Ranjit
2,22, Something Blue," Um, no, we actually had something else in mind.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Okay.,Ranjit
2,22, Something Blue," Lily, go sit down.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Welcome to Wienerburger.,Man
2,22, Something Blue," Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Let me guess. Jefferson High prom?,Man
2,22, Something Blue," No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married.",Marshall
2,22, Something Blue, Wow. Congratulations.,Man
2,22, Something Blue, Thank you.,Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," That's $7.80. Hey, dude.",Man
2,22, Something Blue, Yeah.,Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash.",Man
2,22, Something Blue, My wife...,Marshall
2,22, Something Blue," So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,22, Something Blue," I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for ""the one"" again. The only time I want to hear you saying ""the one"" is if it's followed by the word ""hundredth."" What up?",Barney
2,22, Something Blue," No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?",Ted
2,22, Something Blue," Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Yeah.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue," I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.",Barney
2,22, Something Blue, Could be.,Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Ted?,Barney
2,22, Something Blue," Yes, Barney.",Ted
2,22, Something Blue, Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,21, Something Borrowed, Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, How long is this list?,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Sweet! I can cross off two things.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,21, Something Borrowed, Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, How do you play the harp with your belly so...?,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, You only play half the harp?,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Wow, that's soon.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?""",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Really? That didn't work.,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Bill?,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, He kind of did.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, That's Scooter.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Why? Why would she do that?,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, I'll get it.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Me, too. I was up all night.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Hey, Bill.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Scooter, what are you doing here?",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, I want... I want... Scooter!,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, I need a glass of wine.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," It's for the bride, so...",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, That is a good song.,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?,Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed, What's up with Bill?,Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed, That's Scooter.,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, I'm on it.,Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed, Hey.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Hey.,Woman
2,21, Something Borrowed, Can I have your phone number?,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, No.,Woman
2,21, Something Borrowed, It's for the bride.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.,Woman
2,21, Something Borrowed, The bride wants you to walk slower.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, wow.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, I have hairy nipples.,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, Really?,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," No, but it worked, didn't it?",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.",Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed," There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.,Woman
2,21, Something Borrowed, I'm okay.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.",Man
2,21, Something Borrowed, I'm fine.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Totally cool.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Are you sure?,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Lily, are you okay?",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, What?,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Well, it's not too short.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, The good Backstreet Boys?,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, What-what the hell happened to you?,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," So, um, just not-not too short, okay?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, I can't get married like this! There's no way!,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Ah, let me see what I can do.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, What? What can you do?,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, I have a superpower.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, That's crazy. Of course she will.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, Would you marry me?,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, What?!,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Dude, those guys are criminals.",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, No!,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, The bride needs this.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Actually, I think it kinda works.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, It totally does.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, Barney?,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, you know...",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, In a bad way.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Hey. Cool hair, bro.",Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed, What happened to your shirt?,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.,Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed, You gonna put another shirt on?,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?",Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed, What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Not for long, bro. Not for long.",Brad
2,21, Something Borrowed," Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, no.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, my God! Marshall...",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Lily, you're not supposed to see me.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, What happened? Did Amy do this to you?,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Yeah, I know. I heard.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, I wish we could have that wedding.,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, So do it.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, What?,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.",Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," What do you think, baby?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, I love it.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Okay.,Man
2,21, Something Borrowed, Thank you.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, He's gonna cry.,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," Oh, no. I don't have my vows.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, I don't have mine either.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed," Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, No problem.,Ted
2,21, Something Borrowed, It's totally okay.,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed," My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.",Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Hey, I found your panties!",Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed, I'm good.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Slow down.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?,Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, I do.,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, I do.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.",Barney
2,21, Something Borrowed, Did you smoke?,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, No.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed, Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.,Robin
2,21, Something Borrowed," After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,21, Something Borrowed, How do you feel?,Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed, Tired. I got married twice today.,Lily
2,21, Something Borrowed," So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?",Marshall
2,21, Something Borrowed," What do you think? Bathroom, of course.",Lily
2,20, Showdown, Why does my stomach hurt?,Lily
2,20, Showdown," I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," No, we're not.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," Oh, really? What about the other day?",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Oh, I need to get some eggs.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," Oh, I'll come with you.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?,Barney
2,20, Showdown," Okay, we decided not to do that because of...",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Logistics. Wedding logistics.,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.,Ted
2,20, Showdown, Sure we could.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Then why don't you? You can stay with me.,Robin
2,20, Showdown, It would make our wedding night more special.,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Okay, let's do it.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Done.,Lily
2,20, Showdown, I'm gonna go grab a beer.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra....",Lily
2,20, Showdown, Long story. I'll tell you later.,Ted
2,20, Showdown," Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons.",Robin
2,20, Showdown," Oh, you didn't. That's right.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?,Barney
2,20, Showdown," You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her?",Barney
2,20, Showdown, No.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, He doesn't say it. He sings it.,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.,Lily
2,20, Showdown, What's on there?,Barney
2,20, Showdown," Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...",Lily
2,20, Showdown, Retail price $319.99. What else?,Barney
2,20, Showdown," Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Did you memorize our registry?,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," No, I'm training.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Training? For what?,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, No way!,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, What?!,Ted
2,20, Showdown," Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Whoa, that is so awesome.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.",Robin
2,20, Showdown," Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,20, Showdown, I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.),Lily
2,20, Showdown," Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.",Robin
2,20, Showdown, I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess!  I'm too skinny for my dress!,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?",Ted
2,20, Showdown, That's fantastic.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Oh, crap.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Oh, crap.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, That grandpa died three years ago.,Ted
2,20, Showdown," His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?",Barney
2,20, Showdown, What was that?,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!""",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Yeah, of course.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?",Lily
2,20, Showdown, What happened?,Robin
2,20, Showdown," She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?",Robin
2,20, Showdown," Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflée with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.",Lily
2,20, Showdown, I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.,Robin
2,20, Showdown, Done!,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",Ted
2,20, Showdown, Nice.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, I love you.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.",Lily
2,20, Showdown, Yeah. Ted leaves the room.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Hey, Lil.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Hey.,Lily
2,20, Showdown, Hey? That's it?,Ted
2,20, Showdown, What are you talking about?,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,20, Showdown," Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? ",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Oh, wow, that was pretty close.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!",Barney
2,20, Showdown," What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Your father?,Ted
2,20, Showdown, That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.,Barney
2,20, Showdown, Your dad... is Bob Barker?,Ted
2,20, Showdown, That's right,Barney
2,20, Showdown," The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?",Lily
2,20, Showdown, That's Pops.,Barney
2,20, Showdown, Barney?,Robin
2,20, Showdown, Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?,Robin
2,20, Showdown," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?",Barney
2,20, Showdown," So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?,Ted
2,20, Showdown, Why is this so hard for you people to believe?,Barney
2,20, Showdown," Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.",Robin
2,20, Showdown, This is the best wedding diet ever.,Lily
2,20, Showdown, I lost a pound.,Lily
2,20, Showdown, That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.,Robin
2,20, Showdown, I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!",Robin
2,20, Showdown, I can't.,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.",Robin
2,20, Showdown, I'm trying.,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!",Robin
2,20, Showdown, Okay!,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.",Ted
2,20, Showdown, Finally.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Still strong, right?",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall",Ted
2,20, Showdown, Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.,Barney
2,20, Showdown," Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.",Robin
2,20, Showdown," Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.",Ted
2,20, Showdown, You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?,Lily
2,20, Showdown," Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.",Lily
2,20, Showdown, I know.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.",Ted
2,20, Showdown," Marshall, what are you doing?",Ted
2,20, Showdown, Going to the bathroom.,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, In the hall?,Ted
2,20, Showdown, Sleepwalking?,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, You're wide awake.,Ted
2,20, Showdown, Robbing us?,Marshall
2,20, Showdown, Dude.,Ted
2,20, Showdown," God, I missed you.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Sure, baby.",Lily
2,20, Showdown, How's the weight gaining going?,Marshall
2,20, Showdown," Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around.",Lily
2,20, Showdown," Well, I'm here now.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown, To Lily and Marshall.,All
2,20, Showdown," Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,20, Showdown," Rich, what is the name of our next participant?",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Nooo. Oh, my God!",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Thanks, Da... Bob.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Here is the next item up for bid!,Bob
2,20, Showdown," And Barney, what do you bid on that?",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," $1,350 for Barney.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Thank you, Bob.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.",Bob
2,20, Showdown, $1 billion.,Barney
2,20, Showdown, Lower.,Bob
2,20, Showdown," So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Yes, Barney. This is...",Bob
2,20, Showdown," That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Keep bidding.,Bob
2,20, Showdown," That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...",Bob
2,20, Showdown, $999.,Barney
2,20, Showdown," Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!",Bob
2,20, Showdown," I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around...",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Sure.,Bob
2,20, Showdown," Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?",Bob
2,20, Showdown," $17,640.",Bob
2,20, Showdown, Overbid!,Barney
2,20, Showdown," Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Oh, I love this.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, And the actual retail price of your showcase is...,Bob
2,20, Showdown," $14,628.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...",Bob
2,20, Showdown," Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.",Barney
2,20, Showdown," Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...",Bob
2,20, Showdown, Have your pets spayed or neutered.,Barney
2,20, Showdown, Why didn't you tell him?,Ted
2,20, Showdown," Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.",Barney
2,20, Showdown, Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.,Ted
2,20, Showdown," Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!",Barney
2,20, Showdown, And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,20, Showdown," Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted.",Marshall
2,20, Showdown," No, it's weird.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", This is awesome.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Whoa, pothole. The car stops.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Is it cool if I still light these?,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Surprise.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", We insisted.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Terrific.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", How's the Fiero?,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", She's still in triage.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", She? I thought it was your little boy.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car.",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", How long have you had her... slash him?,Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Oh, how nice of them.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Not really.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", That's it?,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Agreed. Totally agreed.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", You're naked.,Man
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", I'm aware of that.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", You have 50 cents?,Man
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.",Man
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", It is not insane.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Well, I'm trying, but it's...",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Aw, nerts.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Ah, the Fiero-asco.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", What's the 100K fiasco?,Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", The Fiero-asco?,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", And Marshall was a total slob.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Hey  I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", She'd be so bummed if I left early.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", I hear you.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", So... this song.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Don't worry. It comes around again.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", What do you mean?,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", What?,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so...",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Zitch dog.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Zitch dog.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Zitch dog. Damn it!,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", 12-nothing.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Marshall. Marshall.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Zitch dog, blue Suburban.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Damn it!,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", 18-nothing.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Where the hell are we?!,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Really? Seems impossible.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Doesn't seem like a smart idea.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," No, keep driving.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Nah, I threw them out.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", What?!,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", No food or drink in the Fiero.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Wasn't an easy decision.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", This is all because of your insane no-food rule.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", It's perfectly rational.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night. We should've kept driving.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Come on, Marshall.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Yeah?,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Are you still thinking about Lily?,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Yeah.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Please stop. And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.,Man
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Zitch dog!,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Damn it!,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," With privileges, from the sound of it.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Well, it's a pretty old car.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", How dare you...,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Hitchhiking Waldo. The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Guys, what are you talking about?",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.,Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. . Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about.",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Lily, it's gonna be fine.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", These cigars aren't helping at all.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Yeah. This was a terrible idea.,Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", The broken windows?,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", We had to make it look realistic.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Why did you break two of them?,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.,Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.",Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?",Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", What? Why?,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Why? Why? Why?! Why?!,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Hey.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", To Queens?,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero","Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Wait! You know how to drive, right?",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Which pedal's the gas?,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Trick question.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," No, it's not",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Yes, it is.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," No, it's not.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Dude, a dog.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Which? Which one's the break again?,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", The left one.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Make the Ls,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Why did you just turn on the radio?,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Relax. You're being crazy.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", We're okay.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.,Robin
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", True story.,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Yes!,Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.,Lily
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.",Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Affected.,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", That's what I said.,Ted
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.",Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Close enough!,Marshall
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Close enough!,All
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero"," Rot in hell, devil steed.",Barney
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", And what better friend is there than that?,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,17," Arrivederci, Fiero", Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff, How about Mimi's?,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?",Ted
2,16, Stuff, We did?,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!""",Ted
2,16, Stuff, It's also important to know when to stop talking.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff, Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?,Ted
2,16, Stuff, Because it wasn't me.,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Oh, right! It was... my sister.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff," Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, I've never seen Van Helsing.,Robin
2,16, Stuff,  That's right. I saw it with my sister.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Oh, it's so romantic.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, When were you in Maui?,Robin
2,16, Stuff, I... went... with my sister.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, You're right. We should just be honest.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, Totally.,Robin
2,16, Stuff," See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, I don't want to hear that.,Robin
2,16, Stuff, What? You said...,Ted
2,16, Stuff," God, that is so insensitive.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, Remember honesty...?,Ted
2,16, Stuff, You're a jerk!,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Well, you're...confusing.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!",Marshall
2,16, Stuff, I don't know. Is she fat?,Barney
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.",Marshall
2,16, Stuff, Hot off the presses!,Lily
2,16, Stuff, I-I don't take flyers.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, You took one two seconds before you walked in here.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff, That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?,Barney
2,16, Stuff, Fine. It's a flyer from my play.,Lily
2,16, Stuff," Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...",Barney
2,16, Stuff," Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.",Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Yes, you should break up.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," So, earlier tonight...",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Mm, we should get down to the bar.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Oh, God, why is this part of the story?",Barney
2,16, Stuff, We're getting to it.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!",Lily
2,16, Stuff, What's wrong with her?,Barney
2,16, Stuff, She hates that word.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff," What word, ""moist""?",Barney
2,16, Stuff," No! Seriously, stop!",Lily
2,16, Stuff," So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, What are you talking about? It's yours.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," No, it's not.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," No, it's not.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Um, my sister's.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," So, in other words, some girl you went out with.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, Um... I love you.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?,Robin
2,16, Stuff, It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.,Lily
2,16, Stuff, I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, Why is that still in your apartment?,Robin
2,16, Stuff, I don't know. I just never threw it out.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, Not three dollars! Try 14.,Robin
2,16, Stuff, Why is this such a big deal?,Ted
2,16, Stuff, Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Whoa, she wasn't a whore.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...",Ted
2,16, Stuff," No. No! No! Oh, Ted!",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," Nice, right?",Marshall
2,16, Stuff, I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old,Robin
2,16, Stuff, Yes!,Lily
2,16, Stuff," I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker.",Barney
2,16, Stuff, Ted. Ted? Ted?,Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.",Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, You're creepy and gross.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, Your mom's creepy and gross.,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.",Lily
2,16, Stuff, I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff," All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, I side with Robin.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, What?,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Just stop, sweetie.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff," Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.",Barney
2,16, Stuff, Where do you guys want to sit?,Ted
2,16, Stuff, I know where I don't want to sit.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.,Robin
2,16, Stuff, No? Okay.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, I... am Greed.,Woman
2,16, Stuff, I am Rage... Envy!,Lily
2,16, Stuff, I am outta here.,Barney
2,16, Stuff," No, you're not. You have to stay.",Marshall
2,16, Stuff, This is the face of Consumerism!,Lily
2,16, Stuff," Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.",Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Oh, baby, that was wonderful!",Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!""",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Wow, Lily, that sucked!",Barney
2,16, Stuff, Barney!,Marshall
2,16, Stuff," What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, if you're a Smurf.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Oh, really? You would?",Barney
2,16, Stuff, Yes.,Lily
2,16, Stuff," Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.",Barney
2,16, Stuff, We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out,Man
2,16, Stuff, Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?,Robin
2,16, Stuff, I know. He can be really insensitive.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," It was pretty bad, though.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Oh, my God, it was so bad.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Oh, my God, you've been robbed!",Robin
2,16, Stuff, Nope.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?,Robin
2,16, Stuff, What can I say? Papa gets swag.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff," You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Nope. Well, except for my dogs.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," What's your point, Ted?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?",Ted
2,16, Stuff," What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?",Robin
2,16, Stuff, I do now.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, That's ridiculous.,Robin
2,16, Stuff," I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, You said everything.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, But not living things.,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, Things with a heartbeat can stay.,Robin
2,16, Stuff, Enjoying this?,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?",Robin
2,16, Stuff, Guess what position we did it in.,Man
2,16, Stuff," Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," Um, no.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, She's not getting rid of the dogs.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff, What's the matter with you?,Lily
2,16, Stuff, Even I wouldn't do that.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, Yes!,Robin
2,16, Stuff," You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.",Lily
2,16, Stuff, I miss Jebediah.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff," Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.",Barney
2,16, Stuff, Very funny.,Lily
2,16, Stuff," Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," Oh, we'll be there.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...",Barney
2,16, Stuff, Never.,Lily
2,16, Stuff," Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.",Barney
2,16, Stuff, I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.,Robin
2,16, Stuff, I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, So we're-we're okay?,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, we're great.",Ted
2,16, Stuff," And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff," Oh, yeah, that's the spot.",Man
2,16, Stuff," Dude, I gotta pee.",Man
2,16, Stuff, I gotta go.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.",Robin
2,16, Stuff, You're gonna kill your dogs?!,Lily
2,16, Stuff," No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," ""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...",Marshall
2,16, Stuff," I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.",Lily
2,16, Stuff, Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff, Moist.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff, I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.,Barney
2,16, Stuff, I never get picked for audience participation.,Marshall
2,16, Stuff, And then it just got weird.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff," Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!",Barney
2,16, Stuff, And when that didn't work...,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff," Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?",Barney
2,16, Stuff," No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting",Barney
2,16, Stuff," Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.",Lily
2,16, Stuff, Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.,Barney
2,16, Stuff," Yeah, well, anyway.",Lily
2,16, Stuff," It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.",Barney
2,16, Stuff," So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff, Hey.,Robin
2,16, Stuff, Where've you been? I called you earlier.,Ted
2,16, Stuff, I gave my dogs away to my aunt.,Robin
2,16, Stuff, You what?,Ted
2,16, Stuff," Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.",Robin
2,16, Stuff," Wow. Oh, man.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, Can we go inside?,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, Why? What's going on inside?,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Um, the floors are gone.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, What?,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.",Ted
2,16, Stuff, I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!,Ted
2,16, Stuff, You said you threw all that stuff away!,Robin
2,16, Stuff," Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,16, Stuff, We're really doing this?,Robin
2,16, Stuff, Yeah.,Ted
2,16, Stuff," The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, That security guard was a little bit handsy.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hi, wait, two more.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy.",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," I'm sorry, sir.",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Please, I have to be on this flight.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.,Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny, Thanks.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, Your uniforms are pretty.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after.",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel.  Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny, That thing better have call waiting.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, man, it kills.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," You want some aspirin, baby?",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, You know I don't believe in pain killers.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, Marshall used to think he was indestructible.,Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny, There was a really heavy door. He opened it.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, On one pull.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny, Training for a marathon.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, What?,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny, You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," You're kidding, right?",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny, Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny, Absolutely.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny,,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,15, Lucky Penny," Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Ooh, he's starting!",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, This ought to be good. Wow.  He's already passing the second checkpoint.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny, It's really him.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny," What up, non-finishers?",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," Wow. Very impressive, Barney.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.,Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, So where's my 50 bucks?,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," All right. I got to admit, you earned this.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, You're dating a girl from New Jersey?,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, No.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,15, Lucky Penny, Hello?,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," What, what are you talking about?",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny,  Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, Best 50 bucks I ever spent.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Ted, Ted.",Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny, I'm sorry. I can't.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, Barney?!,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, Ted!,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, No...!,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny," See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, So I was able to get you two seats.,Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny, Really? That's great!,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.,Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, he never even called you back?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.",Woman
2,15, Lucky Penny," It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,15, Lucky Penny, What was the name of the airline again?,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, I think it was something like Flights R' Us.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Was the ""R"" backwards?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," God, I hope not.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, Geez.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,15, Lucky Penny, My pants are starting to feel a little tight.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, I cannot allow this.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny, What?,Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, I am going to run the New York City Marathon.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," ""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," ""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.""",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," ""Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.""",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.",Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Marshall? Oh, my God!",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time!  And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hey, what's going on here?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yeah, but for what?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, We have to camp out.,Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, Are you serious?,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny,  I can't go. I've got this thing.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, What thing?,Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, A pen1s.,Barney
2,15, Lucky Penny, This is the place.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, You said wang.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny," You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, That's kind of annoying.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute.  I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny," It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.",Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Morning, ladies.",Man
2,15, Lucky Penny, It's him. It's the car guy!,Lily
2,15, Lucky Penny, Get out of here!,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,15, Lucky Penny, Nobody does it better than you.,Marshall
2,15, Lucky Penny," Marshall?! Oh, my God! ",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.",Man
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, You did that story on the giant pizzas?,Man
2,15, Lucky Penny, Would you check to see if you have any more seats?,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?",Man
2,15, Lucky Penny, Robin...,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny,"  One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny,  I knew it!,Man
2,15, Lucky Penny," God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.",Man
2,15, Lucky Penny, Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.,Man
2,15, Lucky Penny," Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, 1939?! This penny's from 1939!  A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," No, it's not.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, How dare you.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Hey, what's going on?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny, I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.,Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Yeah, but for what?",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny, And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.,Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Uh, sir?",Man
2,15, Lucky Penny," Oh, please tell me you have some good news.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.",Man
2,15, Lucky Penny," All, right, well, thanks for trying.",Robin
2,15, Lucky Penny," I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.",Ted
2,15, Lucky Penny," Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.",Robin
3,1, Wait for It," Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother.  You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,1, Wait for It,"...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, When will you be ready?,Barney
3,1, Wait for It," It was a good question.  After a big relationship ends, you need some time to recuperate. Robin took a trip to Argentina, and I went through my usual routine. ",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,1, Wait for It, I grew my breakup beard.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,1, Wait for It," Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, I'm not ready.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, I repainted the apartment.,Future Ted(Narrator)

3,1, Wait for It," Barney, come on, we've covered this.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Robin!,Lily
3,1, Wait for It," Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael.",Robin
3,1, Wait for It, Hola.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It," Okay, I'm ready.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," I just can't believe her.  We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy? You know what she's doing? She's trying to win the breakup.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," What do you mean ""Win the breakup"", old timey inventor.",Lily
3,1, Wait for It," What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers.",Marshall
3,1, Wait for It," It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition.",Lily
3,1, Wait for It, That's my wife.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It," Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Gael.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It," I'm sorry, Gayle?",Ted

3,1, Wait for It, I'm sorry. So it's Gayle?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It,  What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It," And, oh, he is a masseuse.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your heartbeat.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It," One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It," How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Not possible. You cannot have s*x on a windsurfing board.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It, How do you know?,Lily
3,1, Wait for It," Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have s*x. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had s*x in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It," To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.",Lily
3,1, Wait for It, This conversation never happened.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It," All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.",Ted

3,1, Wait for It, And then we fell asleep on the beach while counting the stars.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It," Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us?",Lily
3,1, Wait for It, There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It," No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy.",Lily
3,1, Wait for It," Well, you did.",Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, I'm one of the lucky few.,Lily
3,1, Wait for It," So that night, as Lily and Marshall did their best to hate Gael...",Future Ted(Narrator)

3,1, Wait for It, I just want to make sure you're okay with this.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It," ""I just want to make sure you're okay with this""? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12.

3,1, Wait for It," Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!",Barney

3,1, Wait for It, I just hope Ted's okay.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It, Hmm.,Marshall

3,1, Wait for It, Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Yeah. But I didn't get to help.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It, So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Apology accepted. Let's go.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It," Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It," Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!",Barney

3,1, Wait for It, Lily?!,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, We carry so much ancient emotion in our neck and shoulders. Things we should have let go of years ago.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It," Oh, I forgive you, Mom.",Lily
3,1, Wait for It," Lily, we are Ted's best friends. Our job is to hate that guy.",Marshall
3,1, Wait for It," Oh, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was building him up so few minutes later, I could totally cut him down.",Lily
3,1, Wait for It, Weren't you wearing a bra?,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks...  sort of.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,1, Wait for It, They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It," You... your v*g1n*... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.",Barney

3,1, Wait for It, I think I'd look way hot with some ink.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Yeah.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?",Barney

3,1, Wait for It, But you need a plan and you need a wingman!,Barney
3,1, Wait for It, This is so going in my blog!,Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Okay.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It," After this maybe. Oh, man, this is going to be legen... wait for it...",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," And that's all I remember.  The next morning, I woke up alone back home. ",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,1, Wait for It," Hey, buddy, how was your night?",Marshall
3,1, Wait for It," You know, it was great. I met this crazy girl, I almost got a tattoo. Don't worry, I didn't. But it was... It was amazing. I think it's safe to say, I am winning this breakup.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Look.,Lily
3,1, Wait for It, Oh my God!,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, What?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Nothing. This J. Crew catalog. Who brings two golden retrievers in a canoe?,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, We've gotta call Barney.,Lily
3,1, Wait for It, Way ahead of you.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It," Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?",Lily
3,1, Wait for It, What?,Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Hum. Ted? Could you grab me the fondue pot?,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It,  He has no idea.  And up we go.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, Thank you.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, Hum. Hum. What?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Ted?,Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Hmm?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It," Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Hmm.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, He's gonna say it.,Lily
3,1, Wait for It, A butterfly?  What?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Nothing, buddy.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God!  I have a tattoo.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Tramp stamp?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, And suddenly it all came back to me.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,1, Wait for It, What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, No no no no no no no. Give me this.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.",Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Maybe you should try club soda.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It," Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil? What happened here last night?",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Last night got weird.,Marshall

3,1, Wait for It, Think I just got over being chunky in the ninth grade.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, You're beautiful.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It, I am beautiful.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, Experience your food.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It, Try the mango.,Gael
3,1, Wait for It," Okay, that's enough of the fruit.",Gael
3,1, Wait for It," We're sorry, Ted. It'll never happen again.",Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, It meant nothing to us. It just felt really really really good.,Lily
3,1, Wait for It, I can't even look at you two right now.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, Ted.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, He got a tramp stamp. ,Lily
3,1, Wait for It, Okay.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It," Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," If you feel like you need to do that, then...",Robin
3,1, Wait for It,"  I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, You shaved.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It,  I did.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, I like the beard.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It,"  I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out!  Okay, I'm done.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It," Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened.",Robin
3,1, Wait for It, You weren't trying to win the break-up?,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, I was trying to survive it.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It," Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It, He's not an Adonis.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It, He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.,Ted
3,1, Wait for It, He's not perfect.,Robin
3,1, Wait for It," Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," ""You're bigger"".",Robin
3,1, Wait for It," Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.",Ted
3,1, Wait for It," No, Ted... ""you're bigger"".",Robin
3,1, Wait for It, Go for Barney.,Barney
3,1, Wait for It," Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.",Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, What is it?,Barney
3,1, Wait for It, Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.,Marshall
3,1, Wait for It, What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," So, beeing married, different? Not different?",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly.,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location.,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, Thanks.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, I am such a jerk.,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yeah. Wait, why?",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, Marshall brownies.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what? It didn't work. So, there.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, You guys are jerks!,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Away from her normal home, her normal life, and it turns out, her normal self.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,2, We're Not from Here," I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, Here. Eat. If we run out of fish I will catch more with my hands.,Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here, A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch!,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, And here I am at the drum circle.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Seen 'em.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Wow. It seems like a great trip.,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Thank you.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Man, this is like ""Where's Waldo"" of exposed genitalia. Except that it's really easy to find Waldo.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a ""Best if banged by"" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being ""Unevolved Robin"", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," I'm telling you, within three days...",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.[/b],Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, What are we talking of? Baseball?,Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here," This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," That night, Marshall, sit down, to write the letter he hoped Lily would never have to read.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,2, We're Not from Here," My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... ""Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother.""  And that's all I remember until the hospital.",Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here, That guy...,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, He's better looking than us.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, No. Because he's from out of town.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Mmm.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here,"  Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on?",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Oh.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Hi, Colleen.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Hi, Lindsay.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," So, hey, you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. What do you say... ah, never mind. No...",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Yeah.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Really? It doesn't seem that lame to me.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, I think it's cool.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, All right.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Okay. All right.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," So, Gael, huh?",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, Mmm.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, Still going strong?,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yeah. It's great. Amazing, fantastic, awesome.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Ooh, that's one too many. What's going on?",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Well, now that I'm home, I'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that I loved on vacation.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Here, taste. Experience your food.",Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, so good.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, Here taste. Experience your food.,Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here," Ooh sofa! Ooh sofa! Sofa, sofa, oh... ooh ",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," We're alone, now. I must have you.",Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here, Ooh.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, I must have you.,Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here, Laptop! Laptop! Laptop! ,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," And you know what else? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from?",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me?",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Gael, there's some weird du..  Hello.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Hey. Good news. I made some travelling friends today, and they'll be staying with us. How do you say... indefinetly?!",Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here, G'day.,All
3,2, We're Not from Here, Wow. Both sides. You wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box.,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Wow, it's a really nice blender.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong?,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong? Except that when you die, I'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were ""Cancel Vogue"".",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, How can you open my letter?,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Marshall, wait.  This was our first fight as a married couple.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, baby.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, Oh.,Lily

3,2, We're Not from Here," Yes, I'm sure this is the best of their 57 ""spudtacular"" east coast locations.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, I'm looking at you. What?,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o?,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," All right, Ignatius, one more hour.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Nice.  Nice. Hey, nice.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Knock, knock.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yes, we do.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. ",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here,"  Now he knows all the streets. Someone's been watching too many ""Steinfield reruns"". ",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Where are we even going anyway?,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get killed.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," There were three of them, at least two guns... they took all our money.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Well. I only had traveler's checks.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Hey, babe. I've been thinking about our fight.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, Yes?,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter?,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, Really?,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Lily, I won't, I promise.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder.,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too?",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff?,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," ""Thank God, we're alive"" s*x.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," ""Thank God we're alive"" s*x. It's even better than ""I can't believe you just proposed to me"" s*x, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Whew.,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, What? West village?,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, West Orange? New Jersey?,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Theodore.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, New Jersey?,Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here, Teddy?,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, no. Oh, no.",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, no.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," New Jersey is not ""pretty much New York"". You are not ""pretty much new yorkers"".",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here," Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to ""pretty much New York""? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!",Ted
3,2, We're Not from Here,"  You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc...",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, Can you please keep it down?,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, Well. I have to have a job.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, I'm canadian. You know that.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, Wow. I just realized something.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, What are you doing?,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," All right, we're living, we're leaving, okay. Michael Moore was so right about americans.",All
3,2, We're Not from Here,  I'm canadian!,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Robin, are you okay?",Gael
3,2, We're Not from Here," No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,2, We're Not from Here," Welcome home, Scherbatsky.",Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.",Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here, Listening.,Barney
3,2, We're Not from Here, This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like.,Robin
3,2, We're Not from Here," Okay, I'm done... but I really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. Can you swear to me you won't open it?",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, Totally. What does it say?,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Marshall, I'm serious.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Okay. I promise I won't, I won't open that until you're dead.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, Okay.,Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," And through 22 wonderful years of marriage, Marshall kept his promise.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,2, We're Not from Here," Until November 1 of last year when, sadly...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,2, We're Not from Here, That's it? I suck. Lily.,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Yes, you suck. You said you wouldn't read it and you did.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here," Well, you didn't keep your promise either. I don't see any dirty pictures in here.",Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here," Oh, fine, I'll take the dirty pictures.",Lily
3,2, We're Not from Here, I don't want 'em now.,Marshall
3,2, We're Not from Here, What is that supposed to mean?,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Use your words, Ted.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, The belt?,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, The belt.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Yes, advantage Ericksen.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," All right, I'm ready, let's hit it.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Can't go. Tournament.,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," What? We agreed, I suited up.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, You take too long to get ready,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, And then he starts on his hair. Ace.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Really?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel,"  3 beers, 5 minutes.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, I saw it first.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.",Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Shekwakie.,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, Stinson.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," All right, the beers are here.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Yeah, we're not gonna make it.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Yeah, pants are off.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Ted.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, Trudy.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape?",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," You were embarrassed? I was like, I really like this guy and now I'm climbing out his window.",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, And I forgot my underwear.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, I am so glad I ran into you.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," I know, do you wanna get a...",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh my God, Rachel, how are you?",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Ted, this is Rachel.",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Let me guess, you guys met in prison.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," And best friends forever, all sophomore year.",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, We have so much catching up do to.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes.",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, I know.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," OK, guys, be cool.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Stinson.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, So you now have two on the line?,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, And I don't know which one to go for.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Go for the new girl.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, New girl? What new girl?,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Are they friends? ,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Are they Betas?,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, I thought we were in for the evening.,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, that's very complicated.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," You're the man-thief, man-thief.",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, You're so funny. I think Ted is funny.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel,  I am never not wearing a suit again.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Hello.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, They are? Are you sure?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Are you positive?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, That is so fascinating. So what happened?,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.",Robin
3,3, Third Wheel, That is so funny. You are so funny.,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Bye mom.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, My mom.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Hello.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Bring me a razor.,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel, What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions?,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving...",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.",Robin
3,3, Third Wheel, I'm on my way.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Neither of us.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," No, you tell him.",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, I don't care.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Nobody cares, just say it.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," OK, on three.",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, One.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, he's right, it's a dead heat.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Two.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Three,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, It's a tricycle.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," No way, no way, no way!",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, What's happening?,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, It's a tricycle.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Put him on speaker.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Wait wait wait, what belt?",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, You actually bought a belt.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," That's right, it's resplendent.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Yes.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Yes.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, What? No.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Ted?,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, are you guys leaving?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Right, well...",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, ""Please, don't, I love my dead wife,"" but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, I already did this morning.,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, Hello.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.",Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," Sorry, I can't leave now.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian",Robin
3,3, Third Wheel, There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," No, but fifty will.",Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, We're combing upsars? What does that mean?,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, He's coming upstairs!,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, Where are my pants? Where's my pants!,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, Got 'em.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Of course we can't promise anything.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, This is gonna be awesome.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, No!,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Yeah bro, up top.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, don't be gross.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh, you can use our bedroom.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, What are you doing?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, I cannot allow Ted to do this.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Why, why?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, I'll get the video camera.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, OK then.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Tom Petty.,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Where's Lily?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Still looking for that CD, so...",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, What are you doing?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, I saw it first.,Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," No, never.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel," OK, take it.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Wish me luck.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Oh my God.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Where's the shaving cream?,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.",Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?",Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?",Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?",Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.",Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel, Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel, You've gotta be kidding me.,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel, Excuse me.,Robin
3,3, Third Wheel," So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Exactly.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," You do like to have fun, don't you Ted?",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel," It's getting late, I'll get your coats.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.",Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel, Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Oh no, the night's ruined!",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Why would you do that to yourself?,Marshall
3,3, Third Wheel," Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, It won't?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, So exhausted.,Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, Why would I want to tire them out?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Why in God's name would I say that?,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Ted, what's wrong?",Trudy
3,3, Third Wheel, I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," OK, what the hell.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," OK, wait for it.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Yeah.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, Yes you can.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.",Lily
3,3, Third Wheel, All right.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, I'll see you on the other side.,Ted
3,3, Third Wheel, What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.",Ted
3,3, Third Wheel," Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel," Ted, belt.",Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?,Barney
3,3, Third Wheel, No problem.,Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel," No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open.",Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel, Why don't I buy you a drink?,Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel, Did I overhear that you're a surgeon?,Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel, You're so funny.,Wendy
3,3, Third Wheel," I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," It was Saturday night in New York City and the young metropolitan set was out on the town, living the kind of crazy lifestyle you can only find in the Big Apple.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,4, Little Boys, 100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys," So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys, What's his 'but'?,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, She's totally hot and really fun.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys,  But she has a dead tooth.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, She's superhot and she's so successful.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys,  But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, She's so cute and she's so smart.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys,  But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys," Wow, set it up.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, I'm still convinced she killed my turtle.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys, Oh.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys, Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, I don't hate kids.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Well, you don't wanna have them.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my v*g1n*,Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Shotgun.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Nice.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," OK, that's awesome.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but...",Robin
3,4, Little Boys,  But she's afraid of commitment.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys,  But she's a gun nut.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys,  But she's Canadian.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys,  But she didn't like Field of Dreams.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, I can't think of anything.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, You don't have a 'but'.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Why?,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, The ultimate ice breaker.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," So, what are the eye patches for?",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, We got bit.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Both of us.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," So, Robin went on a date with George, the guy with the kid. And afterwards...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,4, Little Boys," OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, But?,Lily
3,4, Little Boys, Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys," I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys, Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?,Robin
3,4, Little Boys, A good one. He won full custody.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys," He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Don't tell anyone I said that.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, Theodore...",Barney
3,4, Little Boys,"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, Wow.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Wow. You're here and not in stall two.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, so?",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," OK, Marshall.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Yes.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Which one of us has more game?,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," You're joking. I have mad game, bra.",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Fine.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, That's good too.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, How about her?,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, You're on.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, I win.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, How?,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Ted, she's leaving.",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Get out of my way.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Look who's got game.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, I like that kind.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to...  I hate kids.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, let's take things slow.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," And, kids, that's exactly what she did.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,4, Little Boys," Then on a totally different day that was definitely not the next morning, Aunt Robin had to face her worst fear.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,4, Little Boys," Hey, what's up?",Lily
3,4, Little Boys," It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys, That's a bird's name.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys, No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code?",Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Dude, I'm just reading my paper.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal?",Doug
3,4, Little Boys, Sure.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys, It tastes better milk first.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys, It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Why are you wearing my dad's pants?,Doug
3,4, Little Boys, Milk first it is.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, That's what I said. You're pretty cool.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys, You too.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Meanwhile, Stacy and I had started dating. Oh, Stacy was the girl from the bar. Anyway, I was close to winning the bet when something unexpected happened, I started to really like her.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,4, Little Boys," Well, have fun in yoga.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, You see this. Game face.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Whatever, Ted.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it...",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Nice.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had s*x and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Doesn't count.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Totally counts.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys," OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on what I've already gone  on.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Fine.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, And I only stirred that with my pinky.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, What?,Lily
3,4, Little Boys," Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, What?,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," I hate to tell you this but, too late.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys, He drew it in class today.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys, Oh crap.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys, We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me,Robin
3,4, Little Boys, That's totally you.,Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, You guys are totally crazy.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, It's not me.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," You're joking, right?",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, It's not me.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," ""My new mommy."" Kinda has a nice ring to it.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, Do guys really think this is me?,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys, Really?,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.",Lily
3,4, Little Boys," Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Me too.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, Mm-hm.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Hey, Doug.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Actually, I came to see you.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.?",Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Sure, why not?",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies.",Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,4, Little Boys," We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," So, this picture is not of me?",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Why would I draw a picture of you?,Doug
3,4, Little Boys, How many dates has she been on with your dad?,Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Two.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, We just really connected.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys, And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.,Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Why are you getting so upset, Roberta?",Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember?",Robin
3,4, Little Boys, Whatever.,Doug
3,4, Little Boys," So, that's it, huh?",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Look, you're great, but...",Doug
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, there's always a 'but'.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, That's what you think happened.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, So you never slept with her?,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, Not even at all.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Wow, that's good.",Marshall
3,4, Little Boys, It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Well., have fun in yoga",Ted
3,4, Little Boys, Well?,Barney
3,4, Little Boys, Oh.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Stacy, right?",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, After a while crocodile.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, We are two peas.,Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Wow, take care. Namaste.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys," So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...",Ted
3,4, Little Boys," Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys," Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.",Barney
3,4, Little Boys, I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.,Ted
3,4, Little Boys, I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.,Lily
3,4, Little Boys," Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids.",Robin
3,4, Little Boys," Of course, Robin eventually made her peace with kids. And as you guys know she went on to appear in some very important works of arts. Yours.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,4, Little Boys," That's what makes you so special, baby.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving, No way! March does not have 31 days.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, And we did it all the time.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," Isn't it sad? I mean in 2007, some countries actually still condone corporal punishment.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Because once you start, it's surprisingly hard to stop.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, man, I got a kernel stuck in my teeth.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," But now, we were broken up,so when Marshall said...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," But after the first year,I get a major pay raise.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," We just let it slide. You see, on the surface, Robin and I looked like we were doing great. But the truth is, trying to be friends with your ex is a lot harder than it looks. You can't be as candid as you used to be.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced...  Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving, I gotta go.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, I'm gonna go pay.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, Peeing.,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, I'm gonna help marshall pay.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, I'm gonna help lily pee.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," All right,we have a turkey.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, we do.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, Isn't this exciting? Our first Thanksgiving together as a group.,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, What?,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Bob? You've been on, like, three dates with that guy. We haven't even met him.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal?",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, ""Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob.""",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,""the real Thanksgiving""? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Why are you guys even a country?,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, there, you said it again.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, Said what?,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, Slapsgiving.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving, no.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, How many days are in october?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Uh, thirty.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Is also tomorrow.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Damn it!,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, Slapsgiving.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving...",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, Slapsgiving.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving,"...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, How old is he?,Ted

3,9, Slapsgiving," Okay, kids, the truth is, Bob probably looked like this.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, sweetie.",Bob
3,9, Slapsgiving, Hi.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, But when your ex is dating someone new your mind tends to accentuate their flaws. This is how I saw bob.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, dudes,what's crackin'?.",Bob
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, man, how are you?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Good to meet you. Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with my parents.,Bob
3,9, Slapsgiving, Parents?,Ted

3,9, Slapsgiving, Unbelievable. Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great.,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Nothing but respect for that man.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Is Bob coming?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," No, he went to see green day.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, So it's...,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Making pies.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Pies. They're things that friends make together.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, they do.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Great.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Yeah.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Yeah.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," I'm going to make a phone call.  Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, So you're not coming to make pies.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," No, no. Thank you, mr. President.  Sorry.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," After a very long night, it was finally the big holiday. Sorry, the two big holidays.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, ted.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, happy Thanksgiving.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, yep.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Great.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Marshall?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Lily?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, What do you mean something weird happened last night?,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, You're still getting slapped.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Ooh. terrible.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, What?! I thought it would break the ice.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, How do you respond to something like that?,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Pecan pie? Why are we making that?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Um, it's my favorite.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, You're allergic.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, So we're making a pie for Bob.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Yeah.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, She's got you making pies for this guy?,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, Yeah.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, That is a real slap in the face.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Yes.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Why?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Because he's a thousand years old.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," No, Ted! What are you doing?",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, Right?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Come on.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Ted...,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, It's mean.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, that is...",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," me, too.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, That is a terrible idea!,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, Horrible idea.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," You are correct, Sir.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving,...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, That is a truth-fact.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving,...an event Ted is also attending.,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, kablammo.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, did you guys at least talk about it?",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, I hear something burning...,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Clearly, we need to ignore this.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Clearly, we need to talk about this.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, We need to talk.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Stuffed mushroom?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, We need to talk about last night.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, What?! you're crazy!,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Only because your hand was still around my waist.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, come on! You leaned into it.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, I... leaned into it?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...""Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.""",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, My on-base percentage was off the charts!,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, no! The slap-petizers.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Um, most Thanksgivings.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, I'm not scared.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, Please don't slap me.,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," I'm sorry, what?",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, But it's Slapsgiving.,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, What?!,Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," What's up, dudes?",Bob
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, bob.",All
3,9, Slapsgiving," Baby,please... -no!",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches.",Bob
3,9, Slapsgiving," Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Apparently not.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving," We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.",Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, maybe we should stop pretending.",Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Maybe we should.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, So... what do we do now?,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Okay.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Happy Thanksgiving.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," This is rad! A nice, small,simple Thanksgiving. I'm the youngest of ten in my family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess. All the yelling and the screaming...",Bob
3,9, Slapsgiving, And then a funny thing happened...,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving, It's really a major buzz-kill.,Bob
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh, no...",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, I thought we were done with that?,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, I guess we're not.,Robin
3,9, Slapsgiving, Guess we're not.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving," You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,9, Slapsgiving," Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing.",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Barney, put it away.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," Barney, put it away.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, I will in... five...,Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving, You can slap him.,Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving," What?! Wait, you...",Barney
3,9, Slapsgiving," That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights!  *What is this feelin' that's put you in your place a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face you feel the blood rush to your cheek. Tears start to fill your eyes and your lips are tremblin' but you can't speak,you're tryin', oh, you're tryin' not to cry! You just got sla-apped-oh, oh! Across the face, my friend-oh, oh, oh! You just got slapped. Yes, that really just happened. Everybody saw it and everybody laughed and clapped, it was awesome. Wait,you just got... slapped. Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.*",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving," Well, guys have fun.",Lily
3,9, Slapsgiving, This is gonna be majoy cleaner.,Ted
3,9, Slapsgiving, Major cleaner!,All
3,9, Slapsgiving," Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?",Marshall
3,9, Slapsgiving, That's the general idea.,Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go," So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, He's only been gone a few moments but when he return...,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go, So where were we?,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go,...he gets slap! It kept happening...,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go, Jerk!,Woman
3,19, Everything Must Go, Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go, Again? Really? Wait...,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Barney knew who to look for...,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, No.,Woman
3,19, Everything Must Go, What are you doing on Friday?,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Stop! Amy?,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Abby.,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, Riiiggghhhttt!!!,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go, A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful!,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," But then, that thousand-and-first time...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go," You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hey, how was your day?",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, But we can barely afford that to begin with.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, What? Why just my clothes?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my ""Split Happens"" bowling shirt.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, Dude.,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go, I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, You made a Website?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, it's called ""Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com.""",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Why are you trying to ruin my life?,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, And?,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, That's it.,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Abby!,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Ted said Marshall was his best friend.,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, Seven years!,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Sorry.,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid ""meaningful relationship"" with Stella.",Barney

3,19, Everything Must Go, I hate Ted more.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Are you as turned on as I am?,Abby

3,19, Everything Must Go, I'll sell my paintings!,Lily

3,19, Everything Must Go," But then, that thousand-and-first time...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go,...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, What does that mean?,Lily

3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?",Woman
3,19, Everything Must Go, It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go, We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?,Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go," Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.",Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go," Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors ""neat"" or are they more ""neato burrito?""",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.",Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go, I pull these off!  I pull these off!,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go, You know what I hate most about Ted?,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, What?,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, You know what I hate most about Ted?,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, What?,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," How he's always like, ""Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with."" He's so lame.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, He's so lame and awesome.,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, I think so.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, You're thinking of having s*x with Ted?,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go, Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?",Man
3,19, Everything Must Go," Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Heroin.,Man
3,19, Everything Must Go, Do you like heroin?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin.",Man
3,19, Everything Must Go," Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, It's not very good.,Man
3,19, Everything Must Go," And just as she was about to lose all hope, something amazing happened.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go," 2 Oh, my God!",Man
3,19, Everything Must Go," 500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... ""Suck It!""",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, You bagged a G-CWOK?!,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Uh, yeah.",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hi, Abby.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, We're showing Ted how lame he is.,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," You don't have to say it, though.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Wait, really?",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, I would never joke about true love.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yes, I'll marry you.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, Okay.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, That's you.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.",Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go," Uh, yes, she does.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, Totally committed to the bit.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, You sound happy.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, What?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, So... y-you didn't like my painting?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Really?,Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go, Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Da-amn.,Man
3,19, Everything Must Go," I got a two-syllable ""damn"" in this dress.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," A two-syllable ""damn."" That's the dream.",Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go, Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirlMetroNewsOne.com.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, It's still in the family.,Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go," Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, What?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, Really? Why?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, It's still in the family.,Robin
3,19, Everything Must Go," And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Well, what happened?",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, Here's the important part.,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go, I'll be in the cab.,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go, G-CWOK-approved.,Ted
3,19, Everything Must Go, The painting!,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, You're about to find out.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Ooh, we don't need the details.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, Really? Dogs like my paintings?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, Really?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, In what?,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, In you.,Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,19, Everything Must Go," Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.",Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go," Man, birds do not get you.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hi, sweetie.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, What?,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go, Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.,Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go, Really?,Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.",Abby
3,19, Everything Must Go," Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.",Barney
3,19, Everything Must Go," Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com.",Marshall
3,19, Everything Must Go, We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles,Lily
3,19, Everything Must Go, You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.,Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro," Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life.  The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,18, Rebound Bro, Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," It's Barney.  Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro,"  Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, No I'm not.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Sh! Let it out, let it out.",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, Goodbye Barney. ,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, So are you two back together?,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro, No.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," I miss Barney. I haven't ""high five"" with anyone like a week. I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro, Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me?,Robin
3,18, Rebound Bro, Yeah! She had just as much s*x with Barney as Barney had with her.,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro, You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird.,Robin
3,18, Rebound Bro, I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. It's that's simple.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, I will tell you why he is not mad. Because he is so happy with Stella.,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro, She was right.  Stella and I had been dating for two months. And things were going really well.  She had mat my friend in past for flying colors. There was just one little problem.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,18, Rebound Bro," You guys haven't had s*x yet!!?? When Marshall and I were two months, we were doing it 24/7.",Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro," I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, So what you guys waiting for?,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro," I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Wait, so you haven't had s*x since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then.",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro," Oh baby, do you remember Martin Luther King day?",Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro," Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro," Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing?",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?",Randy

3,18, Rebound Bro," Assistant under secretary of only ok. Thank you, I will not let you down.",Randy

3,18, Rebound Bro, Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson.,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, Yes finally!,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. ,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro," So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," Let's have s*x. Right now, I'll lock the door.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Oh, there is no lock on that door.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird between me and the door tomorrow.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, You've been so patient Ted. The truth is... I'm kind of nervous. I have a confession to make.,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, I was afraid of this. You're 14.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," No, um... it's kind of embarrassing, but it's been a while since I was intimate with anyone.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Really? How long it's been for you?,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, It's been a while.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Tell me.,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Me too!,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, It's been five months for you too?,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Wow. Stella hasn't had s*x since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had s*x, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro," Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.",Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro," The last time Stella had s*x, the world was just learning about SARS.",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro," Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?",Robin
3,18, Rebound Bro," Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, But nobody in five years?,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," In my defense, they were staring at me.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro, Actually...,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Your pillow talk's a little rusty.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," That's great. Like ""right now"" ready? ",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," The last time Stella had s*x, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro, Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.,Robin
3,18, Rebound Bro," Not the movie, the book.",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro, Wow.,Robin
3,18, Rebound Bro," It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro,  It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. ,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro," Oh, San Francisco!",Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro," I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.",Robin
3,18, Rebound Bro, Not Nell Carter... Stella.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro, Because you're dead inside?,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, No. ,Robin
3,18, Rebound Bro," Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute?  Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back.  Tomorrow works.,Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro, I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Fancy?,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever.  Huh. That's surprising.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, What?,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, No.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Quick on the draw?,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, No.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Unexpected number of testicules?,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs. ",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," ""Unexpected number of testicules?""",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. ,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Hey.,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, What up bro-seph Lieberman?,Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro," No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word ""bro"" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro,"  Goodbye ""Geraldine Ferrar-bro"".",Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro," You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, What a loser.,Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro," But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro," Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.",Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro," Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. ",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, Ok.,Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro, You ready?,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro," Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no!",Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro, What? What's the matter?,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro," Nothing, let's do this.  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!",Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro, Randy what are you doing?,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro,"  Hey, laddies. Have you met... ",Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, Hey.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Hey.,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Ted. Five years.,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Straight to the hotel?,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, Straight to the hotel.,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, I'll get my bag. ,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Hey, guys.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Hey.,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro," Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight?",Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro, Yeah. Definitly. It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a ""night out"".",Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro, This one wakes me up at 4am sometimes just to have a little night out.,Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro," Um, what are you guys talking about?",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Nothing. Pizza. What are you talking about?,Lily
3,18, Rebound Bro, Hey guys.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Ted, you told them, didn't you?",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, Told them what?,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro, You told them that I haven't had s*x in five years. ,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, You haven't had s*x in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!,Marshall
3,18, Rebound Bro," Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Ted, that was so personal. Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro," No, they don't.",Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having s*x.",Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, 13 years??!!,Barney
3,18, Rebound Bro, I peaked really young.,Randy
3,18, Rebound Bro, That's why it was difficult for me to tell you. But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.,Stella
3,18, Rebound Bro, You can trust me.,Ted
3,18, Rebound Bro," Obviously, I can't. You know there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy, and you just gave me yours.",Stella
3,17, The Goat," In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, Check.,Robin
3,17, The Goat," Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?""",Robin
3,17, The Goat," Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend",Barney
3,17, The Goat, And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.,Robin
3,17, The Goat, Best friend.,Barney
3,17, The Goat," Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.",Robin
3,17, The Goat," Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.,Robin
3,17, The Goat," Okay. Right. So, Robin?",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Yes, Barney?",Robin
3,17, The Goat, Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?,Barney
3,17, The Goat," I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.",Robin
3,17, The Goat, Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,17, The Goat," So, tell us, what was it like?",Ted
3,17, The Goat, What?,Barney
3,17, The Goat," Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.",Ted
3,17, The Goat, I... I... I'm... I'm...,Barney
3,17, The Goat," Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Yeah, you are.",Robin
3,17, The Goat," Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.",Lily
3,17, The Goat, What are you talking about?!,Barney
3,17, The Goat," The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?",Ted
3,17, The Goat," Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin?",Barney
3,17, The Goat, I'm good.,Robin
3,17, The Goat," Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?",Ted
3,17, The Goat," Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?",Barney
3,17, The Goat, Liking video games?,Ted
3,17, The Goat, I'm gonna get a drink.,Robin
3,17, The Goat, I'll come with you.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, Okay.,Robin
3,17, The Goat," God, this is awkward.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, What is?,Robin
3,17, The Goat, Being around Ted.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, Why?,Robin
3,17, The Goat, Because of our thing.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, What thing?,Robin
3,17, The Goat, You're really gonna pretend this never happened?,Barney
3,17, The Goat, What never happened? What are you guys talking about?,Ted
3,17, The Goat, Nothing.,Robin
3,17, The Goat," Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.",Ted
3,17, The Goat," Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, Hello.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Hey, Marshall, I need your help.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat, I know. I want to hire you.,Barney
3,17, The Goat," For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat, I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, How much?,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, A little.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, I'll take it.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?",Barney
3,17, The Goat, Of course. Why are you upset?,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept...  Stop..stop doing that.  I slept... I slept with Robin.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, You slept with Robin?,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, Are you mad at me?,Barney
3,17, The Goat, I don't know.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, How's the hot dog?,Barney
3,17, The Goat," It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat, You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, Why are you doing this to me?!,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,17, The Goat, Some were unbelievably complicated.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,17, The Goat, And some were just plain disturbing.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,17, The Goat, This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?",Barney
3,17, The Goat, I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.,Barney
3,17, The Goat," And I shall l include a provision that stateth ""No eye contact in a devil's three-way.""",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Listen, what do you want me for?",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Yeah, because you slept with Robin.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, And you would pay me for that?,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!",Barney
3,17, The Goat," While Marshall examined the Bro Code, Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,17, The Goat," And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?",Lily
3,17, The Goat, Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.,Lily
3,17, The Goat, Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?,Girl
3,17, The Goat, And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from... So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,17, The Goat," Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.",Girl
3,17, The Goat," I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday.",Lily
3,17, The Goat," Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?",Ted
3,17, The Goat, I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof.,Lily
3,17, The Goat," Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.",Ted
3,17, The Goat," And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat would go on to do in that bathroom was so... No, you know what? I'm m getting ahead of myself. We'll get there.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,17, The Goat," Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?",Robin
3,17, The Goat, How'd you know that was a goat turd?,Ted
3,17, The Goat," Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?",Robin
3,17, The Goat, Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.,Ted
3,17, The Goat, Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, Talk about what?,Ted
3,17, The Goat," Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?",Marshall
3,17, The Goat, How does everyone know that's a goat turd?,Ted
3,17, The Goat, Barney told you.,Robin
3,17, The Goat," I don't know what you're talking about,madam.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking.",Robin
3,17, The Goat," Robin, come here!",Ted
3,17, The Goat," Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.",Robin
3,17, The Goat," Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, So he saved you from an avalanche?,Woman
3,17, The Goat, Yes.,Ted
3,17, The Goat, And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?,Woman
3,17, The Goat, Yes.,Ted
3,17, The Goat, And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer who used to be a member of the Russian mob?,Woman
3,17, The Goat, Da.,Ted
3,17, The Goat," Article 29 ""A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight.""",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.",Ted
3,17, The Goat, What?!,Barney
3,17, The Goat," Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.",Ted
3,17, The Goat, Hey.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, That feels nice.,Woman
3,17, The Goat, Good.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, I just wish we had some wine.,Woman
3,17, The Goat," Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat, What if he never wants to talk to me again?,Barney
3,17, The Goat," Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Hey, where are you?",Lily
3,17, The Goat,"I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...",Lily

3,17, The Goat,"Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, Okay. Bye.,Lily
3,17, The Goat," Whoa, you guys went all out.",Ted
3,17, The Goat," Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are!",Lily
3,17, The Goat," Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?",Ted
3,17, The Goat, Vegas.,Barney
3,17, The Goat, Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.,Ted
3,17, The Goat," Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, So there's no roof party?,Ted
3,17, The Goat," Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Take me home, Barney.",Ted
3,17, The Goat," No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.",Barney
3,17, The Goat, You slept with Robin.,Ted
3,17, The Goat, You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!,Ranjit
3,17, The Goat, When did you find out?,Barney
3,17, The Goat," Hey, Robin. Come here!",Ted
3,17, The Goat, What's up?,Robin
3,17, The Goat," I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...",Ted
3,17, The Goat," Oh, crap!",Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Anyway, uh, I came across this.",Ted
3,17, The Goat, From my vacacation in Vermont.,Robin
3,17, The Goat," Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.",Ted
3,17, The Goat, I slept with Barney!,Robin
3,17, The Goat, What?,Ted
3,17, The Goat," It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends.",Robin
3,17, The Goat, Of course we can still be friends.,Ted
3,17, The Goat, So you're not mad?,Robin
3,17, The Goat," Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.",Ted
3,17, The Goat, So you're not mad?,Barney
3,17, The Goat," No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.",Ted
3,17, The Goat, I'm so relieved to hear you say that.,Barney
3,17, The Goat," Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!",Ted
3,17, The Goat, Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat," Marshall, can we keep the goat?",Lily
3,17, The Goat, No.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, But she's so cute and furry and soft.,Lily
3,17, The Goat," Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels.",Marshall
3,17, The Goat, Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?,Lily
3,17, The Goat," Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house.",Robin
3,17, The Goat," Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.",Lily
3,17, The Goat, Marshall!,Robin
3,17, The Goat, I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing?,Lily
3,17, The Goat," What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.",Robin
3,17, The Goat, I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff?,Lily
3,17, The Goat," Lily,come on.",Robin
3,17, The Goat, Hot wax?,Lily
3,17, The Goat, Stop it.,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, Did he tie you to anything?,Lily
3,17, The Goat, That's enough. What's wrong with you?,Marshall
3,17, The Goat, I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?,Lily
3,17, The Goat, Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!,Ted

3,17, The Goat, You mean... what position?  Stop it! Stop it!,Barney
3,17, The Goat, Hit him!,Ranjit

3,17, The Goat, Stop!,Barney
3,17, The Goat, Hit him!,Ranjit
3,17, The Goat," Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face.  Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?",Barney
3,17, The Goat," You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, ""don't do this""?",Ted
3,17, The Goat," Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...",Barney
3,17, The Goat," I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled ""stuff I have no use for anymore.""",Ted
3,17, The Goat, What does that mean?,Barney
3,17, The Goat, It means... maybe you belong in that box.,Ted
3,17, The Goat, Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?,Barney
3,17, The Goat, I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.,Ted
3,17, The Goat," Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.",Barney
3,17, The Goat," Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to kill you?'",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Which maybe events that week, all the more surprising.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Totally. What's the occasion?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No, it wasn't like that.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Sounds to me like he gave you your first ""O, Canada!"" face.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted...,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit?",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand,"...others were crude, and ill-formed...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Um, something about fur trapping.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand,"...and others were obvious, but needed to be said...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Did you ride his Zamboni?,Barney

3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig...",Robin

3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, What?,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh?",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, Simon?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, No! Tell me you did not load the drum set.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I did.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy?",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you?",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I have no idea what you' talking about.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, You're starting out with two big ones right there.,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Point Robin.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Um, he never became a rock star.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Point Robin.,Lily

3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Point Simon.,Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Wait. Do they have a wave pool?,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, No.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.,Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Okay, what the hell just happened?",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Hey, Simon.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Um... ... okay. Go.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No, I didn't know...",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, The Foreskins are still playing?,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I know. I'm sorry.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," So, Simon, how did you guys meet?",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Starred in it is more like it.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I'm sorry. I've seen ""Let's Go to the Mall"" about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, There's another video?!,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, No.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Okay.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," It's called ""revertigo.""",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, I don't know about ""revertigo.""",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," You know who gets really bad revertigo?  Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Michelle? She sounds hot.,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, You don't know about Lily and Michelle?,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, No. What about Lily and Michelle?,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, What?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, What...  Do they make out?,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Better.,Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Comparable.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Comparable.,Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I got a second chance.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, What happened?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, He came by my place tonight...,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Simon. What are you doing here?,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, I like where this is going.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, The coup de grace.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Finish him!,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I'd love to!,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, hell, no!",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I think you're gonna enjoy this.,Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, That my girl Michelle?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, How she livin'?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, For reals.,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Yeah!,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, That rocked.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, uh, sure.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," And now it's time for ""Puppy Corner,"" some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, What's revertigo?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, You do?,Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Yeah. Ted.,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Me?,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," 'Sup, Shmosby?!",Punchy
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, You want to go?,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I'm already there!,Punchy
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand,"Yeah, it was a real shock.",Punchy
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Why?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, No reason.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, That's exactly what my mom would say.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, ""We forbid you from seeing this boy.""",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Lily!,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, like, a billion years ago.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," You've been drinking, haven't you?",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, You're not going to that show tonight!,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Hey, so, today at work...",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Not now, Ted!",Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Geez.,Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," God, I just love seeing you so happy.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, What?,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Well... I'm sorry, Robin.",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," I'm fine, really.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?",Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.,Lily
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," So, how's Columbia?",Ted
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Um, can I make an observation?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Revertigo?,Marshall
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," No, tonight.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Ooh. Really? Oh! Oh, come here.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Right. Of course, the-the first being you.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Barney, do you want to come back to my place?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Your place?,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Are you sure you want to do this?,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Of course. So, should I just put it in?",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, why not?",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Oh, I'm so glad.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Is that Alan Thicke?,Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, Yeah.,Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Yeah, you're right. I was lame.",Robin
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand," Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.",Barney
3,16, Sandcastles in the Sand, He was my sidekick. He had to be.,Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, A new car!,Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, You can't call shotgun for eternity.,Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I just called it.,Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," You can't just call things, barney.",Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I call that I can call things!,Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hey, baby.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Beer.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Are you okay?,Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Beer.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Okay, what happened?",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war...,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming,"...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Dude, we're lawyers now.",Man
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Totally.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, We've got briefcases and everything.,Man
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Freakin' briefcases.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, You have anything in yours?,Man
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Totally empty. you?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Candy bars.,Man
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hey, Marshall....",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming,"...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... Artillery arthur.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, How's your morning going?,Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, It's going fine. How is yours?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet?",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," He is, he's in... just in his office next door.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," That's great... have a good one, buddy.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," You, too.  You never know who's gonna get hit...",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yeah, sorry.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...""",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in ""the ninja report"" yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hey, Ferguson.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, How's your day going?,Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I gotta go.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet?",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, And then...,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, He screamed at me.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, All of what?,Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Is ""boy"" the right word?",Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," God, you're hot right now.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Here's what I would do if I were you.,Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hi, Arthur.",Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.",Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Please, I have a family.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, So we good?,Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, We're so good.,Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Then why are you still in my office?,Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Observe.,Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Arthur?,Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," What do you want, Marshall?",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, You are nailing this.,Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," You got me hooked, reel me in.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.,Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.,Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...",Bilson
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, snap.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, What?,Bilson
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, my God.",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, He peed on the conference table?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, That's it? that's the end of the story?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," No, no, of course not... he died.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Chain of screaming?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I thought it was a chain of screaming.,Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I don't scream at Lily.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, So it's not a circle.,Robin
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, God.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming,"...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hello, Arthur.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hello, Marshall.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, yeah.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...,Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, That's it.,Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming,...just throw her on the bed...,Lily

3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",Ted

3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Look, just tell me what happened first.",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",Ted

3,15, The Chain of Screaming," No, I didn't want meatloaf.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," No, I don't.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Who would I even scream at?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, No.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?",Robin

3,15, The Chain of Screaming," I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.",Marshall

3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Marshall.,Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Excuse me?,Marshall

3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Hey, what are you guys doing out here?",Barney

3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Well, that's just not true.",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming,You can't call shotgun for eternity.,Robin

3,15, The Chain of Screaming,It's case by case.,Robin

3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Yes.,Barney

3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," No, I'm kidding... keep going.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be...",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming,"... I quit, Arthur! I quit!",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Well, thank you, Eriksen, I needed to hear that.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i...",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," No, no, no, the part where you said, ""I quit."" Now we don't have to pay you a severance package. Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.",Arthur
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, Dude!,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I'm sorry.,Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Ted, screaming never solves anything.",Barney
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," No, you're not.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, What?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, I love you.,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," I love you, too.",Lily
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet without going bust on the apartment.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,15, The Chain of Screaming, You sure about this?,Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Ted, I don't think I can accept...",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Marshall, don't make me scream at you.",Ted
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," Thanks a lot, buddy.",Marshall
3,15, The Chain of Screaming," You guys did it in the car, didn't...",Ted
3,14, The Bracket, Hey.What's with the blackboard?,Robin
3,14, The Bracket, It's our NCAA bracket.,Ted
3,14, The Bracket, Big board equals big luck!,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket," Hey, that looks familiar, where did you get it?",Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Hello. Uh, I'm looking for my wife, Ms.Aldrin.",Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Of course. How could I forget?,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Big board!,Ted
3,14, The Bracket, Big luck!,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket," We found it. No big deal. Anyway, every year, Ted and I go in together on this big money pool out in Staten Island.",Marshall
3,14, The Bracket," Yeah. The winner gets $100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.",Ted
3,14, The Bracket, And you get to keep the duffel bag.,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Why do you guys put yourselves through this? You lose every year.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.",Ted
3,14, The Bracket, Your team lost 20 minutes ago.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I didn't know they were playing today.,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," You okay, Barney?",Lily
3,14, The Bracket, Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?,Robin
3,14, The Bracket, There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Of course there are.,Robin
3,14, The Bracket," Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, You could not be more evil.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I was only gone for a second when...,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, See? Skid-proof.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Pet store?,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket," Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.",Ted
3,14, The Bracket," God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I'm really bored at work.,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Oh, I want to take her home right now.",Woman
3,14, The Bracket," Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Ooh, ooh, ooh!",Lily
3,14, The Bracket, Lily.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket, No. Marshall.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Oh. No. Robin.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.",Robin
3,14, The Bracket," Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I'm so sorry.,Woman
3,14, The Bracket," My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Why does this keep happening?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, But the next night got even weirder.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,14, The Bracket, Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, You never gonna believe what just happened.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Alan Alda?,Lily
3,14, The Bracket, No.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Oh, my God. Where is she?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, She must have left. She...,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.",Lily
3,14, The Bracket, Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Yes!,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, It's karma.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?",Ted
3,14, The Bracket," My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I have one. It's called my marriage license.,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket," Come on, let's see the list.",Ted
3,14, The Bracket," Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face.",Lily
3,14, The Bracket, How many of these girls know they're being photographed?,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you.",Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.",Robin
3,14, The Bracket, Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.",Lily
3,14, The Bracket, This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!",Lily
3,14, The Bracket, The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!",Robin
3,14, The Bracket, It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!",Robin
3,14, The Bracket," Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Damn it!,Robin
3,14, The Bracket," Okay, toss up. ""Thought I was Jorge Posada,"" or ""You have my dead wife's kidney?""",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Kidney!,Ted
3,14, The Bracket, Jorge Posada!,Robin
3,14, The Bracket, She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!,Lily
3,14, The Bracket, That's true...,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," It's ""Dead wife's kidney."" How are we even discussing this?",Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Fake baby!,Lily
3,14, The Bracket, Lost at sea!,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Fake baby!,Ted
3,14, The Bracket, Lost at sea!,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, ""Girl who thought I owned Google,"" up against the number seven seed, ""Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.""",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, You got to go scuba instructor.,Ted
3,14, The Bracket, You're kidding me!,Robin
3,14, The Bracket, She got the bends!,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," Yeah, she did.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Evil twin!,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," Barney, you're the tiebreaker.",Robin
3,14, The Bracket, I'm going with Evil Twin.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, You're kidding me!,Ted
3,14, The Bracket," Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.,Robin
3,14, The Bracket, Is that the blackboard from my classroom?,Lily
3,14, The Bracket, Come on! Marshall?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I'm tired and sad.,Marshall
3,14, The Bracket, Mosby?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.",Ted
3,14, The Bracket," Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, You guys stole my blackboard!,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, No.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," What do you mean ""no""?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, ""I'm sorry.""",Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Barney, you're doing this.",Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Look, Meg, we need to talk.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, And I forgive you. I love you.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...",Lily
3,14, The Bracket," So you remember who this one is, right?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.",Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Ah, there she is.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," You're really enjoying this, aren't you?",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I'm making a scrapbook.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Anna, hi.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, What Web site?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,14, The Bracket," Okay, which one is this again?",Lily
3,14, The Bracket, She's...,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Is it her?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, Smile.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket, You look good. Have you lost weight?,Barney
3,14, The Bracket," We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, She's gonna kill you.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket, Holly.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket, We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.,Lily
3,14, The Bracket," No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.",Barney
3,14, The Bracket," Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.",Robin
3,14, The Bracket, That's not a bad idea.,Barney
3,14, The Bracket, I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.,Robin
3,14, The Bracket, I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.,Ted

3,14, The Bracket, You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?,Robin

I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her.

3,13, Ten Sessions, Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.,Ted
3,13, Ten Sessions," You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face.",Lily

3,13, Ten Sessions," What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, I would never read that piece of crap. Some patient left it here.",Stella
3,13, Ten Sessions," Oh, thank God.  I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, ""Get a life, people!""",Ted
3,13, Ten Sessions," Ted, I found your book.",Abby

3,13, Ten Sessions, There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.,Ted
3,13, Ten Sessions," Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp.",Marshall
3,13, Ten Sessions, I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.,Ted
3,13, Ten Sessions, You didn't actually say no.,Ted
3,13, Ten Sessions, What do you mean?,Stella
3,13, Ten Sessions," All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?",Ted

4,9, The Naked Man," A toast... Mitch. The sum of its parts makes him a man.But when it serves its parts, it becomes much more. It does not fit the definition of a hero, but he is the one I needed. The hero who helped me get over the disaster of the failure of my marriage and I was almost back in the saddle. He lives in the shadows. Is this a dream? The truth? A fiction? Damnation?Salvation? It is all that and also, no nothing. Because it is...""The guy with hair.""",Ted

5,2, Double Date," Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?",Robin

5,2, Double Date," Thanks, man.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date, You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.,Barney
5,2, Double Date," Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?",Marshall
5,2, Double Date," Meanwhile, Jen and I were at my favourite first date restaurant... for the second time.",Future Ted(Narrator)

5,2, Double Date, I do! It's just not that easy.,Marshall
5,2, Double Date, False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.,Barney
5,2, Double Date," Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date," It's time, baby.",Lily
5,2, Double Date, I will never love again.,Marshall
5,2, Double Date," No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.",Lily
5,2, Double Date,  This one's for you Lily.  Where do I sign?,Marshall
5,2, Double Date," And then watch out, because it is on!",Marshall

5,2, Double Date," Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.",Ted

5,2, Double Date," Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.",Ted
5,2, Double Date," They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.",Ted
5,2, Double Date," Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we?",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Well, you've got your cats.",Ted
5,2, Double Date, This is insane.,Jen
5,2, Double Date," Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?",Ted
5,2, Double Date," Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there... ",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Main Lobster. They spelled ""Maine"" without the ""e."" Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...",Ted
5,2, Double Date," I get it, Ted.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.,Jen
5,2, Double Date, Huh. I had no idea.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?",Jen
5,2, Double Date," That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.",Ted
5,2, Double Date, Huh. I had no idea.,Jen
5,2, Double Date," This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.",Ted
5,2, Double Date," We really are. Okay, I'm in.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Great.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Where'd we go next?,Jen
5,2, Double Date, I think we went to MacLaren's.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Okay.,Jen
5,2, Double Date," Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?",Jen
5,2, Double Date," And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Tone down the kitty talk. Check.,Jen
5,2, Double Date, You will not believe who we saw tonight.,Barney
5,2, Double Date," Dude, um...",Marshall
5,2, Double Date, We saw the third doppelganger!,Barney
5,2, Double Date, I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,2, Double Date," Hey, hey, hey, hey! ",Barney
5,2, Double Date, Lesbian Robin.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,2, Double Date," And Moustache Marshall. By the following summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,2, Double Date," Ladies, meet Stripper Lily. ",Barney
5,2, Double Date, Oh!,Lily
5,2, Double Date," Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.",Barney
5,2, Double Date, So you went to a strip club?,Lily
5,2, Double Date, Busted.,Barney
5,2, Double Date, And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?,Lily
5,2, Double Date," Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...",Marshall
5,2, Double Date," Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.",Lily
5,2, Double Date, So... Strip club.,Robin
5,2, Double Date, Marshall made me go.,Barney
5,2, Double Date," All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.",Ted
5,2, Double Date," Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Not really.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Really? I can't feel my fingers.,Jen
5,2, Double Date, I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?",Jen
5,2, Double Date, See? Why didn't you lead off with that?,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.,Lily
5,2, Double Date," See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.",Barney
5,2, Double Date, I'm not cool with it.,Robin
5,2, Double Date, Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.,Barney
5,2, Double Date, It's disgusting.,Robin
5,2, Double Date, Because it's harmless.,Barney
5,2, Double Date, Did one of your whores tell you that?,Robin
5,2, Double Date," And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.",Barney
5,2, Double Date, Trouble? What trouble?,Lily
5,2, Double Date," It's, no, it's nothing.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date," Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.",Barney
5,2, Double Date," No, we're not.",Robin
5,2, Double Date," Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date," You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!",Lily
5,2, Double Date," Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date, Remember? ,Ted
5,2, Double Date," Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, You loved them.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," They're family, Ted.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly ""can't think"" of anything I do wrong.",Ted
5,2, Double Date, Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check,Robin
5,2, Double Date," Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.",Lily
5,2, Double Date," Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!",Marshall
5,2, Double Date, Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.,Jen
5,2, Double Date, Me?,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Yeah. We were all sitting over there... ,Jen
5,2, Double Date," And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...",Jen
5,2, Double Date, What about Cat Woman?,Lily
5,2, Double Date," Yeah, that would've been good.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Psst! Ted! ,Barney
5,2, Double Date,  Nice.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.",Ted
5,2, Double Date, Nice.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, We were checking out Moustache Marshall.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Yeah, well, it's nice to know ""past me"" wasn't a total jackass, huh?",Ted
5,2, Double Date," ""Present you"" isn't so bad, either.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Thank you very much.,Jen
5,2, Double Date, You got it.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best",Ted
5,2, Double Date," Me, too.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?,Ted
5,2, Double Date, I remember now.,Jen
5,2, Double Date,  Wow.,Jen
5,2, Double Date," Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?",Ted
5,2, Double Date," Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me?",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Absolutely.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Promise?,Jen
5,2, Double Date, Promise.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, I have been so busy.,Ted
5,2, Double Date," Good night, Ted.",Jen
5,2, Double Date, Hello?,Jen
5,2, Double Date," Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.",Ted
5,2, Double Date," Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, killing me off.",Lily
5,2, Double Date," All right, we got to fix this.",Lily
5,2, Double Date," Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.",Lily
5,2, Double Date," Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date, Bring out Stripper Lily!,Lily
5,2, Double Date,"  You know, I don't come here that much.",Barney

5,2, Double Date," Thank you, kindly stranger.",Barney
5,2, Double Date," I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?",Lily
5,2, Double Date, That was a hundred?,Marshall
5,2, Double Date," Wow, she crawls fast.",Lily
5,2, Double Date," Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.",Ted
5,2, Double Date," The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what",Ted
5,2, Double Date, Wow.,Jen
5,2, Double Date, Wow.,Marshall
5,2, Double Date, You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.,Barney
5,2, Double Date," I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.",Robin
5,2, Double Date, Just the best.,Barney
5,2, Double Date," Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date, Just the best.,Barney
5,2, Double Date, ... now what?,Jen
5,2, Double Date, I just remembered why I didn't call you.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Why?,Jen
5,2, Double Date," I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.",Ted
5,2, Double Date, What?,Jen
5,2, Double Date, And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.,Ted
5,2, Double Date, Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.,Jen
5,2, Double Date," Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?",Ted
5,2, Double Date," Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," Well... good luck out there, Jen.",Ted
5,2, Double Date," You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.",Jen
5,2, Double Date," And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,2, Double Date," Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.",Marshall
5,2, Double Date,"  What did you say, buddy?",Lily
5,2, Double Date, Lily?,Marshall
4,7, Not a Father's Day," I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.",Barney
4,7, Not a Father's Day, And those girls over there? They are cannon.,Ted
4,7, Not a Father's Day, Absolutely not.,Barney
4,7, Not a Father's Day," Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known.",Lily
4,7, Not a Father's Day, You hate me?,Robin
4,7, Not a Father's Day, A max.,Lily
4,7, Not a Father's Day," Barney, they are canon.",Marshall
4,7, Not a Father's Day," There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod.",Barney
4,7, Not a Father's Day, Anything.,Ted
4,7, Not a Father's Day, Look at it carefully. Individually.,Barney
4,7, Not a Father's Day, I know. The last one is kinda cute.,Marshall
4,7, Not a Father's Day," Yeah, really cute.",Lily
4,7, Not a Father's Day," And this, my friends, is ""the effect cheerleaders."" Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed.  Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember.",Barney
4,7, Not a Father's Day, What?,Ted
4,7, Not a Father's Day," Apparently, I'll be a father.",Barney
4,7, Not a Father's Day, You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?,Ted
4,7, Not a Father's Day, It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow.,Barney
4,7, Not a Father's Day, That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.,Lily

4,6, Happily Ever After, That's not true?,Lily
4,6, Happily Ever After," Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up.",Barney
4,6, Happily Ever After," I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?",Barney

4,6, Happily Ever After," It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game.",Marshall
4,6, Happily Ever After, And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.,Robin
4,6, Happily Ever After, The blue line?,Barney
4,6, Happily Ever After," You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.",Robin
4,6, Happily Ever After, You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?,Lily
4,6, Happily Ever After," That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one.

4,6, Happily Ever After, No.,Marshall
4,6, Happily Ever After," If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. ""At home"" is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!",Ted

4,6, Happily Ever After," I know exactly what I say.  You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.",Ted

4,5, Shelter Island," Yes, and they are all 100% vegan.",Woman
4,5, Shelter Island," I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?",Barney
4,5, Shelter Island, There's no meat.,Marshall

4,5, Shelter Island," Yes, but it's your ex girlfriend. It's weird.",Stella
4,5, Shelter Island, But no.,Ted
4,5, Shelter Island, It's weird. Not what you imagine is to see her boyfriend's ex marriage.,Stella
4,5, Shelter Island, Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day.,Robin
4,5, Shelter Island," When the former are present, I dunno, it brings back...things unresolved. Close with your ex, do you know that the flame will not turn back?",Stella
4,5, Shelter Island," Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.",Ted
4,5, Shelter Island, Have you bet money against you in this quarrel?,Stella
4,5, Shelter Island, She already has his ticket.,Ted
4,5, Shelter Island, It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy.,Stella

4,5, Shelter Island, What should I do?,Ted

4,5, Shelter Island, You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.,Lily

4,5, Shelter Island," The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control.",Lily
4,5, Shelter Island, Do not you remember?,Marshall
4,5, Shelter Island, The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?,Lily
4,5, Shelter Island," After a while, is that the waffle.",Marshall
4,5, Shelter Island, Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.,Lily

4,5, Shelter Island, Let me talk to Stella first.,Ted

4,5, Shelter Island, What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.,Stella
4,5, Shelter Island, To be fair... your ex is here.,Ted
4,5, Shelter Island, You've invited!,Stella
4,5, Shelter Island," Come on, it's not weird.",Ted
4,5, Shelter Island," It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal.",Stella

4,5, Shelter Island, Sorry to have run away like that.,Ted

4,5, Shelter Island," Take that, bitch! I won!",Stella
4,5, Shelter Island," It was broken, there is more than a year.",Ted
4,5, Shelter Island," Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.",Robin
4,5, Shelter Island," So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.",Ted
4,5, Shelter Island, That's not it. It's just...,Robin
4,5, Shelter Island, Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.,Ted

4,5, Shelter Island, What does that mean?,Ted
4,5, Shelter Island," You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.",Robin
4,5, Shelter Island, I did the rain.,Ted
4,5, Shelter Island," It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.",Robin
4,5, Shelter Island, I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.,Ted
4,5, Shelter Island, Yes.,Robin
4,5, Shelter Island," You stop it.  My God, so, stop.",Robin
4,5, Shelter Island, I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?,Robin

4,5, Shelter Island," The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order...",Barney
4,5, Shelter Island," In addition, Barney.",Robin
4,5, Shelter Island," OK, let's go. Who's that?",Nora
4,5, Shelter Island, The girl on reception.,Barney
4,5, Shelter Island," Children, sometimes you think you live a story, but the truth turns out to be quite different.  In those days, I thought it covered only the presence of Robin marriage.  If only I had understood what it was about.",Future Ted(Narrator)

4,13, Three Days of Snow, A car.,Ranjit
4,13, Three Days of Snow," Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance.

4,15, The Stinsons," It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, Very good program.,Robin
4,15, The Stinsons, Bob Barker is your father.,Marshall

4,15, The Stinsons," I hired an actress to play my girlfriend ""Betty"". His real name is Margaret. It is mainly small theaters. Superb actress.In it a Moliere. I say no more. This is political. I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," You see, Mom? I found someone who makes me happy. As you wished.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, It's beautiful. I wish I could stay for small children.,Loretta
4,15, The Stinsons," And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep ""Betty"" and make a casting to find my son, Tyler.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?,Lily
4,15, The Stinsons," For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," You said if I slept with you, my son would have the role.",Woman
4,15, The Stinsons, Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11!,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant.,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," Come on, Grant looks pretty good.",Ted
4,15, The Stinsons, Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left.,Lily
4,15, The Stinsons, It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.,Marshall

4,15, The Stinsons," Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.",Ted
4,15, The Stinsons, I always wanted to be an actor. It is this kind of dream that flies away with time.,Ted
4,15, The Stinsons, Really?,Ted
4,15, The Stinsons, You do not like playing the son of Barney?,Robin
4,15, The Stinsons, I have not had surgery.,Robin
4,15, The Stinsons, I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great?,Lily

4,15, The Stinsons, Do not say that. I'm sure you were great.,Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons," Yeah, I was rather a drag.",Loretta
4,15, The Stinsons, I'm sorry?,Lily
4,15, The Stinsons," A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, ""I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet. "" Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive.",Loretta
4,15, The Stinsons, Barney Mom? Loretta.,Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons," Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect.",Loretta
4,15, The Stinsons," You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.",Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons," No, no question. The truth would kill her.",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?",Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons," Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, ""Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. """,Lily
4,15, The Stinsons, She was joking.,Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons," She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget.",Lily
4,15, The Stinsons, You're going to say what?,Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons, Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?,Lily
4,15, The Stinsons," On the bed ""race car""?",Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it.",Marshall

4,15, The Stinsons, You know what? I hate you!,Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons," In two minutes, meat loaf!",Loretta

4,15, The Stinsons, Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, What kind?,Robin
4,15, The Stinsons, The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!,Barney

4,15, The Stinsons," No, not at all.",Lily
4,15, The Stinsons, And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?,Loretta

4,15, The Stinsons," Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.",Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons, It was cute.,Loretta
4,15, The Stinsons, We're a happy family.,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen.,Loretta
4,15, The Stinsons, No weak link in this scene. Bravo!,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs.",Robin
4,15, The Stinsons, You can stop with that?,Marshall
4,15, The Stinsons, Go and eat your ice.,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, It's time for ice!,Loretta

4,15, The Stinsons, What can you have to say for yourself?,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?",Ted
4,15, The Stinsons, Sorry. What?,Barney

4,15, The Stinsons, You've lost your mind?,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons," Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.",Ted
4,15, The Stinsons, What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?,Barney
4,15, The Stinsons, It may be time to tell him the truth.,Lily

And what am I left with?  Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily.  But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair?

4,18, Old King Clancy, I need to hear Lily.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, Who told you to leave?,Bilson
4,18, Old King Clancy, Bilson killed every one of my original ideas. Then one day the GNB has withdrawn from the project to create a new working group to oversee my plans. Everything changed at once.,Future Ted(Narrator)
4,18, Old King Clancy," On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home.",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, Everything was fine until one day in the elevator.,Future Ted(Narrator)
4,18, Old King Clancy," Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try.",Woman

4,18, Old King Clancy," He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story.",Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy," No, not the end of history. I need to know who, what, when and where. Balance!",Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy," Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," Not you, Barney.",Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy, Who's who?,Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, Now you've spun him hiccups.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection.",Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy," What do you mean ""collection""?",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.,Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy, Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much.",Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy, So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian s*x act.,Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, Yes.,Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy, Tell us.,Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.,Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy, It is simply impossible.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, Right.,Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy, I do not even know of Canadian s*x act.,Lily

4,18, Old King Clancy," Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, Point org?,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, It is said? It should.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, No. I want to.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, There's been no light.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, What's going on?,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," It's time you know. A few weeks ago, Bilson called us.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, We abandon the project for the new headquarters. This recession is killing us. It cancels all the superfluous. And I have difficult choices to make during my semi retirement in St. Croix.,Bilson
4,18, Old King Clancy," Dude, Ted will be devastated.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, Not if he learns his best friend.,Bilson
4,18, Old King Clancy," Tell him, you're his best friend.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," No, it's you.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, How are you?,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, You okay?,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, You should leave the project.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, It's funny you mention the project. Because...,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, What was that?,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, But if I can.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," Lie to me, there.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, I have a spaceship.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, What kind of fuel?,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, I have no spaceship.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, It is what color?,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, We did it to protect you.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," In Canada, it's called a snow plow Vicious.",Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," Sorry, Ted.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, I need a drink.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, The poor. It's moved if I return to Canada on s*x?,Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, Not at all.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, You've been slow.,Barney

4,18, Old King Clancy," Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection.",Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy," Well, I'm starting. Bryan Adams. He collects baseball cards and he wanted to make you... an oily Kayak.",Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, No.,Robin

4,18, Old King Clancy, No.,Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy," Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, No. I would have accepted it.,Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy," Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," You see Roy Waterman, Vice President of Venture Capital? It's actually... Roy maintenance.  I'm sorry, Roy. How would you like to make you some money?",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," Louisa Mendoza, Vice President at Capital exécutie, It's actually... Louisa from the cafeteria.  Louisa, I need your help, but forbidden to speak.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say ""secret"" in Spanish?",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street.  Excuse me. One can argue?",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, It was completed with the group of trainees and paid $ 50 for them to look enthusiastic when you talked...,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," Alex Trebek, a Guardian Eventé, teddy bear!",Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, No.,Robin
4,18, Old King Clancy, Damn!,Lily
4,18, Old King Clancy, Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, Good job.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, All right!,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, Is there anything else you want to tell me?,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, When you played third base for the softball team GNB.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, My lap of honor was bogus?,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, Lying?,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," Sometimes, yes, to protect them.",Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. ""Trout. ""Right? ""Sturgeon.

4,18, Old King Clancy, It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy," It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone.",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," For me, it's called a...",Robin

4,18, Old King Clancy," If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy," This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us.",Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," Wait, what is a P.T.E.?",Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, Room for Transitional Employees.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, What does that mean?,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy, It turns people here.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?,Ted
4,18, Old King Clancy, GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.,Marshall
4,18, Old King Clancy, It's serious there.,Barney
4,18, Old King Clancy," Reluctantly, I agreed to design a room where people turn. But I was determined to put my key.",Future Ted(Narrator)

4,19, Murtaugh, No list of Murtaugh.,Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, What is the Murtaugh list?,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh, The Murtaugh list was created around my 30th birthday. It all started with the beer funnel your uncle.,Future Ted(Narrator)
4,19, Murtaugh,"... two, one, chug!",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," Stuff. He said, ""I'm too old for this stuff. """,Future Ted(Narrator)
4,19, Murtaugh," It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh, I'm too old for this stuff.,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.,Ted

4,19, Murtaugh," ""Riggs. ""I'm too old for this stuff. In fact, it's Lethal Weapon?",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian.

4,19, Murtaugh," The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Yeah!,All
4,19, Murtaugh," Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little sh1ts, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! Suicide, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh," Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, And if you fail?,Ted
4,19, Murtaugh, I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.,Barney

4,19, Murtaugh," Come on guys, you do it!",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," ""To pierce the ear. ""Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother.  Do you mind if I use your futon?",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, There is no futon.,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," Put it there, guys.",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, What's the matter?,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," It's on the list. ""Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. """,Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, I'm too old for this stuff.,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh, You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.,Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, ""pushing a medical"" on the list.  Hold on. Bar here...",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh," It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things.  you not being there! You fall!",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room.",Future Ted(Narrator)

4,19, Murtaugh," OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth!  You should have a straw?",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey.",Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow.",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Winning? There are no points.,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, What?,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, There are no points.,Lily

4,19, Murtaugh, I was training.,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, That's my little angels. You are luminous beings of light.,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," Because that's the point of playing, having fun.",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy?",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," Everyone. This is a participation trophy, everyone has one.",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, Everything that's Chinese to me.,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," Hi, this is Barney.",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, And Robin.,Robin

4,19, Murtaugh," I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh, Okay. It's good. You have your own list.,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh, What?,Ted
4,19, Murtaugh, A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old.,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," Removes ""colonoscopy"" and ""sleeping with an old"", and is a cinch.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh," Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh, Bet held.,Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, An agreement of honor!,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that.",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, Sure. I learned that way.,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that?,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," Come on, Dad. I'm tired.",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, I'm trying.,Marshall

4,19, Murtaugh," It... ""Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer.""",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh, Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh, 16 pm! Supper time.,Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes.",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children.",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, There are different...,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Is that clear?,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Ted Calls. I want to go.,Barney

4,19, Murtaugh," I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun.",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," Children, over time your Uncle Marshall rehashed the story this game hundreds of times. And in fact, children from the other team were older than one class. But harping on the story, they looked like that.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,19, Murtaugh," Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not shoot! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later.",Marshall

4,19, Murtaugh," It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh, The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?,Robin
4,19, Murtaugh," Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is killing me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.",Barney
4,19, Murtaugh," You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal Weapon.",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh," I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal Weapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal Weapon 4, I realized...",Ted
4,19, Murtaugh, And then the hospital.,Barney
4,19, Murtaugh," Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0.",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun.",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," Because they did not want to argue in front of children, your uncle and your aunt Lily Marshall had a telepathic conversation.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,19, Murtaugh, Do not look at me like that.,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy!,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Stop yelling at me!,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way?,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar.",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," Was it the determination of Marshall, Lily of encouragement, or the magic combination of both, but in the second half, the disorganized group of little urchins... have actually made things worse. In fact, according to Uncle Marshall, in the second half, the other team had even grown.And one of them had changed into a werewolf.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,19, Murtaugh, There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded.",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh," It was not a market, right? You're killing me! You kill me outright!",Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, I beg you to put me in one.,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," When the final whistle sounded charitably, the score was, according to the estimate of Marshall, 118 to nothing. And even if they did not win, everyone, including the coach, received a trophy for participation.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,19, Murtaugh, I understand that you like it not.,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value.,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh," I know, baby.",Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, Your way is perhaps not completely stupid.,Marshall
4,19, Murtaugh, Thank you. Yours is.,Lily
4,19, Murtaugh, Really?,Barney
4,20, Mosbius Designs, I heard a joke at work.,Barney
4,20, Mosbius Designs," Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.",Ted
4,20, Mosbius Designs," It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it.",Barney
4,20, Mosbius Designs, Do it yourself.,Marshall
4,20, Mosbius Designs, Tell it.,Lily

4,20, Mosbius Designs, For the guys.,Ted
4,20, Mosbius Designs, She will not like it.,Marshall
4,20, Mosbius Designs, Why do not I decide? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?,Lily

4,20, Mosbius Designs," Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?",Marshall
4,20, Mosbius Designs," Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire.",Barney
4,20, Mosbius Designs, I would like to have your insurance.,Marshall
4,20, Mosbius Designs, You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.,Barney
4,20, Mosbius Designs, I work harder than anyone in my division.,Marshall
4,20, Mosbius Designs, Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.,Barney
4,20, Mosbius Designs, What do you mean something?,Marshall
4,20, Mosbius Designs," You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco.",Barney
4,20, Mosbius Designs," Marcus Denisco worked in accounting, and it was probably the worst employee of the box.",Future Ted(Narrator)

4,20, Mosbius Designs," Yes, the guide.",Robin
4,20, Mosbius Designs, I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.,Ted

4,20, Mosbius Designs, All right.,Ted
4,20, Mosbius Designs, This table just told me that you're an idiot.,Robin
4,20, Mosbius Designs, This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers.,Robin
4,20, Mosbius Designs," I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test.",Ted
4,20, Mosbius Designs," Okay, but PJ does not help.",Robin

4,20, Mosbius Designs, Tell her how you feel?,Marshall

4,20, Mosbius Designs," No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.",Robin
4,20, Mosbius Designs," The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.",Ted

4,20, Mosbius Designs," Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.",Ted

5,1, Definitions," Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?",Lily

5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Uh, no, it doesn't.",Barney

5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!",Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""?",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Not really.,Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, No way.,Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!",Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.",Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, We have. Go on.,Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!,Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Wait, you guys were serious about that?",Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Oh, we never joke about b&b's, especially at the height of syrup season.",Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.",Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth.  The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.",Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.",Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, What's going on?,Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.",Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Plus, the alien thing.",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Come on,Marshall.",Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Let's go.,Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, No...Lily...,Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.,Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, I think they bought it.,Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, I can't believe they broke up with us.,Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, We're so lovable.,Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.",Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, I thought we did everything right.,Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.,Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.",Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," It was true.Marshall had become addicted to creating songs and photo montages documenting various mundane events. So for months, all of Marshall's friends and professional colleagues were getting e-mails like this...",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. ",Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...",Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.,Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.",Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.",Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," One thing?  One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?",Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!",Lily
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, You're right.,Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Thank you.,Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, All that sexlessness has made you wise.,Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, For god's sake!,Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.,Robin

5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Just the two of you?,Woman
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.",Robin
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Hey, guys.",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Maybe. But they're Armani.,Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?",Ted

5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.,Marshall
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?",Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?,Lily

5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, We'll never sleep on thegouda again.,Barney

5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," 'twas the night before, I had hours to kill.  I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.",Ted
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper, With quill?,Barney
5,4, The Sexless Innkeeper," Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.",Ted

7,1, The Best Man, What do you think of this tie?,Barney
7,1, The Best Man," Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?",Ted
7,1, The Best Man, This one is better?,Barney
7,1, The Best Man," The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.",Ted
7,1, The Best Man," I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?",Barney
7,1, The Best Man," Yeah, sure.",Ted
7,1, The Best Man, I do not really talk about the tie.,Barney
7,1, The Best Man," Yeah, I realized that Barney.",Ted
7,1, The Best Man, I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?,Barney

7,1, The Best Man," These marriages have become associated as the worst moment of my life. The love between Joel and Mora is magnificent. I thought I had the same thing... Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle.  After losing my job last week, I asked not to give this toast...  No, no, no! The happy couple should hear. It's over. But from the ashes of your divorce statistically probable, hope can be reborn. That is why I opened my own architectural firm Mosbius Designs.  Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!",Ted
7,1, The Best Man, A Schmosby classic.,Punchy
7,1, The Best Man, Wow. Punchy has posted weaknesses of your life?,Robin

7,1, The Best Man, This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.,Future Ted(Narrator)
7,1, The Best Man," Here's your speech. ""In single file, girls. No big. """,Barney
7,1, The Best Man, This is ridiculous.,Ted

7,1, The Best Man, Do not say a word until we know that all is well. Ok?,Lily
7,1, The Best Man," Ok, so everything will be okay. Promised.",Marshall

7,1, The Best Man, You've been too focused on your work.,Robin
7,1, The Best Man," No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight.

5,6, Bagpipes, I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.,Ted

5,6, Bagpipes, I gotta go.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, They have a big problem.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half.",Barney

5,6, Bagpipes," According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, Let me ask you a question.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Go ahead.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Not really.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," But if I said that, we will play, so...",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," You argue. Robin, we do not fight.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Of course I do.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Why is there a bag of pants marked ""April 2008"" in your closet?",Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, So when you think you will play and you get up you go?,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, This is not true.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, I can not believe Robin supports it.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, The ties go to the machine?,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, Call me crazy.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, Mad.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Barney, you came home!",Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, Go to the basics!,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, Okay.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Thank you, doll.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Honey, you're going to wash it?",Lily
5,6, Bagpipes," I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, No. Of course not.,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes," Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, It's because you're a woman.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, I do not even know why we laugh!,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, Of course not.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Are you kidding me.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes," Now, turn around.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, You beat him or I do it?,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, He's right.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, The piercing was cool.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," It was cool, huh?",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, Stay with me! Barney is wrong.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, You just said the opposite!,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, You're welcome.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, I think that's true.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, I told you.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy.",Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, Thank you.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Have fun.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, Will it work.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, A second time. This is a bad idea.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, No. She will be angry and you will play.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, It is a slap bet?,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, We bet a slap.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
5,6, Bagpipes," Lily, I am delighted that you mention.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, I can stay here tonight?,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," I am preparing the couch, man.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, The ski babes are back!,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, How was the trip?,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, Okay.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags.",Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, We all came out a year.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," short, and your weekend?",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
5,6, Bagpipes," Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, ""Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies. "" You see? It's just...",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," What happened to the ""I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love""?",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, I should have noted.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, I'm making more money than you.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, Excuse me?,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, Dance for me.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, It started with the dishes but after...,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me.,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes," It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit.",Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance.",Lily
5,6, Bagpipes," Do not do that, please.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, He's right.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, What do you eat?,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Well sh1t, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.",Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," Hey, Ro-Ro.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, Nothing. We're just happy.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," As Gandhi said, ""A smile costs nothing, baby.""",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, So you talked to the neighbors?,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, Some old?,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, Really old.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, So you did what?,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some racist comments and I left.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, The days of Barney and Robin continued to be happier than ever.  and Marshall and Lily have continued to argue.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,6, Bagpipes," I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself.",Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, You will perhaps have to do it again.,Lily
5,6, Bagpipes, And I heard more than a bagpipe parade of St. Patrick.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,6, Bagpipes," I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes," You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Thank you, Robbie Engineering.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, I do not like nicknames.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," Seriously, stop.",Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, It's T-Mose.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, I do not like with you either.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose.",Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, T-Mose was great. I think of the show.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.,Marshall
5,6, Bagpipes, They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes," And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,6, Bagpipes, How will Marshall and Lily?,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Those two worry me, really.",Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," You and your big, huge heart.",Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Enough. The game is over.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, What do you mean by that?,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes," Who, him?",Robin
5,6, Bagpipes," It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too ""surnomants"". It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.",Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, How would you know that?,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, Phil told me.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, Who the hell is Phil?,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Your downstairs neighbor.,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, I'm Phil. 12-B.,Man
5,6, Bagpipes, And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?,Ted
5,6, Bagpipes, All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, It's your board that is zero.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, You're on the side of Lily? You...  No. We will argue and I can not spin.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, Or so I tried the jump?,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, Or just the pants?,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, This trick of dodging is over?,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, I think.,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, You have the? This is the smallest!,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, They fight because of you!?,Robin
5,6, Bagpipes, And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.,Barney
5,6, Bagpipes, All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.,Robin

5,22, Robots Versus Wrestlers, I can not believe!,Lily
5,22, Robots Versus Wrestlers," Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original...  I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an asshole. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest asshole on the planet. I wish someone stops me.",Ted

5,22, Robots Versus Wrestlers, You're right. No need to rush.,Marshall
5,22, Robots Versus Wrestlers," What do you say that? We agree that it makes no sense to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?",Lily
5,22, Robots Versus Wrestlers," Sure, it goes without saying.",Marshall

5,20, Home Wreckers," Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",Lily
5,20, Home Wreckers," Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really sh1t to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers," Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",Marshall
5,20, Home Wreckers," Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",Robin
5,20, Home Wreckers," Yeah, you have leaky pipes. But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by.",Man
5,20, Home Wreckers," You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",Lily
5,20, Home Wreckers," You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",Ted

5,20, Home Wreckers," Not so fast.  was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter.

I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.",Man
5,20, Home Wreckers," But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers," It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",Barney

5,20, Home Wreckers, You're always a little too far.,Marshall
5,20, Home Wreckers, sh1t.,Barney
5,20, Home Wreckers," Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.",Man
5,20, Home Wreckers, Really?,Ted

Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working.

5,20, Home Wreckers, And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?,Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers, I'll see at the top if all goes well.,Man
5,20, Home Wreckers, He said he had found a tramp?,Marshall
5,20, Home Wreckers," Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers, I see a complaint.,Barney
5,20, Home Wreckers, Found termites.,Man
5,20, Home Wreckers," Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has killed some cockroaches at the time of impact.",Robin
5,20, Home Wreckers," Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.",Lily
5,20, Home Wreckers," You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?",Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers, Thank you. My God.,Barney
5,20, Home Wreckers, Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.,Ted

5,20, Home Wreckers, I wanted to be your father!,Barney
5,20, Home Wreckers, What does that mean?,Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers," Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.",Barney
5,20, Home Wreckers, And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.,Barney

5,20, Home Wreckers," Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.",Robin
5,20, Home Wreckers," Okay, this is a Mellencamp.",Barney
5,20, Home Wreckers," Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.",Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers," Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all?",Lily
5,20, Home Wreckers, It's silly.,Ted
5,20, Home Wreckers, Your mother and I were at second base.,Barney

5,19, Zoo or False, It's good. It's good.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, It was downright terrifying.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, It was downright terrifying.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, What are you doing?,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, It will not work. If?,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, Not a bit.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, I authorize you to do.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," I do not think there's a gun to my Marshmallow. Now, I tremble. I think I will not sleep all night.",Lily
5,19, Zoo or False," Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep.  Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a f*cking baby.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, Robin puts it.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security.,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a gun. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. """,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Baby, do not worry for me, I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I am New York. I will not let me change it.",Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, I changed! I like the weapons now. Charger.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, Maybe there should be a pause..,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," I said, ""shipper"".",Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, You wanna buy a gun?,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," No one who scares. A tiny Beretta pink that goes with these cute sandals I just bought. In fact, our new credit card works.",Lily
5,19, Zoo or False," You do not need a weapon. All studies in the world come together to say that a home is safer with no weapon, especially ours. You know how I ever hurt you unintentionally.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," Pretty easy, huh?  Dispatch, baby. The party will begin.  You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat!",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, I have changed my mind.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False," Now, you want to add a weapon in this equation?",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a gun at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would...",Lily
5,19, Zoo or False," I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," Wait, so...",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
5,19, Zoo or False, It's good. It's good.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, He assaulted you naked?,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, I do not ask where he kept his weapon.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, We're sure it was a weapon?,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," No, guys. I came home from work on foot. Through Central Park, and I stopped at the zoo.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
5,19, Zoo or False, It's good. It's good.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You're telling us...,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, What you got mugged...,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You've been mugged by a monkey?,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a weapon.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, Forget the weapon. It is on that now.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Really? They caught him?,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, He is behind bars.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," So, where did they find?",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.",Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," You know how they caught him, huh?",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, They tracked.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, They tracked!,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, What's happening?,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, Okay. That's what happened.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You're right. The banana was on the floor.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Was not... Was not banana banana.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Do not shoot. There was no banana!,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You've been mugged by a monkey!,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, What? Him in your program? And my model?,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, And you invited back for a second interview.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, It would be nice to see you on TV.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey?,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You've been mugged by a monkey.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, I've just been mugged.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, What?,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, My poor darling.,Woman
5,19, Zoo or False," Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Why you call it Neil?,Woman
5,19, Zoo or False, The cyclist?,Woman
5,19, Zoo or False, You've just mugged?,Woman
5,19, Zoo or False," Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Me too.,Woman
5,19, Zoo or False, And it was the best thing in my life 3.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, You're the lemon in your hair.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Really? Cool.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, It's a little embarrassing. So what?,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, That's not it. Guys... I'm not assaulted by a monkey.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, Not at all.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," No, that's not it.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, So you got the monkey attacked?,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gun.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, That would be the right size.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, I can not believe.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, What?,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, I would not?,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," If serious, this is too funny.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," I, yes, but still.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, But I can not lie on national TV.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You know a long time. He told the truth?,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Ted, do not do that...",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, I still say that it happened.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, You mean what you done to him.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," 31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, You know it.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a gun? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, Yeah! I knew it.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Come on, Ted.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,19, Zoo or False," Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," Dude, what do you do?",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, Now I want a weapon.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, The monkey is there.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," Because of this incident, we will send Captain Bobo in a nature reserve.",Man
5,19, Zoo or False, I bet he will love it.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False," No, ma'am. You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long.",Man
5,19, Zoo or False, The name of his companion is Milly?,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, And then the interview began.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,19, Zoo or False," In your own words, describe what happened.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, We talk about that. We speak your aggression.,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False," People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it?",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, We come back.,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, It's good.,Mike
5,19, Zoo or False, What are you doing?,Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a gun.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You have not been attacked by a monkey?,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False," What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.",Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, It's good. I buy a gun.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False, No. I got mugged.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, So Bobo goes.,Man
5,19, Zoo or False, No! I have not been mugged!,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False, You know if it was attacked?,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, I have no idea.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo?",Man
5,19, Zoo or False, Tell us just what happened.,Lily
5,19, Zoo or False," Yes, tell us the truth.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,19, Zoo or False, Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.,Marshall
5,19, Zoo or False," And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,19, Zoo or False," sh1t. Okay, put a microphone.",Robin
5,19, Zoo or False, Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,Barney
5,19, Zoo or False," Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.",Barney
5,19, Zoo or False, I doubt it.,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False, The children you will not believe what happened.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,19, Zoo or False, The monkey escaped!,Mike
5,19, Zoo or False," Bobo, just there, Bobo.",Man
5,19, Zoo or False, He climbs the building!,Mike
5,19, Zoo or False," Bobo, come here.",Man
5,19, Zoo or False, I'll get it.,Mike
5,19, Zoo or False, It's really happening?,Ted
5,19, Zoo or False," Of course, Ted.",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch," In March 2009, I went out a few weeks with my high school girlfriend, Karen. My friends were not really happy.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,17, The Front Porch, Hi all.,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, Hi.,All
4,17, The Front Porch," Sorry, can not stay.",Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, It's unfortunate!,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, Disgusted!,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, They are real diamonds?,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch," Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you.",Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, I did not say that I loved.,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, I got a great deal...,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, I'm sure that minors exploited in Sierra Leone you would type in five if they still had their fingers. But it's nice.Meet me at the top.,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, They need a finger to do what I think.,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch," Ted, Karen is an idiot.",Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, Nice set of forms.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, I put the forms there.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch," Believe it or not, my friends do not have a say on which I frequent. This is my life. I decide.",Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, Now!,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, I arrive.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch," I do not know what it is, this shrew. Okay, she has boobs, but... In fact, I see.",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, That's because he met her in high school. This is his first girlfriend.,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch," For us, Karen is an idiot. For him, this is the first to have touched his pen1s in hand himself, his mother and pediatrician.",Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, It's almost 2am. I must work.,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch," How can they call it a ""daily""? 4h, it's still the middle of the night. You impressed me.",Lily
4,17, The Front Porch," It's been almost a month. I'm used to. And then the show is not bad, right?",Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, That is clear.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, I've never seen.,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, You've ever watched?,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, Sure!,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, I've never seen.,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, Your favorite item?,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, Weather.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, I've never seen.,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, Have you ever looked.,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, Sorry.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, I just said.,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch," I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look.",Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, You're the best.,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, We want to encourage you.,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, I just want to sleep!,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, I hate Robin not to have done better.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, I knew you were listening!,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch," We should not celebrate. Ted has just been dumped.Tell us everything, everything that happened. Seriously, do not forget any details. She said what? You, you said what? How you going? If you had to redo it from start, perhaps you...?",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, How did that happen?,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch," This is totally stupid. We were together, you know, we laughed...",Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, It's you who love the Chianti 2002.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch," No, it's you who love the Chianti 2002. Expect. What is this?",Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, Looks like the earring Robin. Bizarre. It's you...,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, What's she doing here?,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, I know.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, Have you slept with Robin?,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, Why I believe you?,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch," Maybe because I've always been faithful, when thou hast deceived me 6 times, bitch.",Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, In your face!,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, Right? I too would have said that.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, Why I believe you?,Karen

4,17, The Front Porch, I knew it was a mistake. It's good. It's over.,Karen
4,17, The Front Porch, That's it. She's gone.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, What a story. What courage to share it with us.,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, Wait. That's your pajamas? You sleep in pajamas suit?,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, Of course. You think I'm sleeping in it?,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, A coffin.,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, It's not look comfortable at all. You wear a tie.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch," First, it's a tie night. Second, it's not for comfort. This class is to be at any time.",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, Why have the class at any time?,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, Let me tell you a story that happened to me recently.,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch," It's not an anecdote, it's a porno.",Ted
4,17, The Front Porch," This is not ""a"" skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it.",Lily
4,17, The Front Porch," But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it.",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch," Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally...",Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch," Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, ""Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? ""It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, ""Held danger of Ninja,"" if you want. You stay still a transvestite.",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, I do not care. It's comfortable.,Marshall

4,17, The Front Porch, Wait! Marshall did nothing. It's me. I made you break.,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that?,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, I did it for your own good. You do not see how it was horrible. She failed the test of the porch.,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, What is this test?,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch," You, Me and Marshall are friends since college. Imagine how they account for one another. So when I look to the future, I see us all together.  When will retirees, sipping tea on the porch of our house, playing bridge all day.",Lily
4,17, The Front Porch," You know not to play bridge, eh?",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, It will take over.,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, It's important to stay active.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch," So whenever you go out with someone for a while, I take the test of the porch. How that person will fit over the years?And when I think of Karen...",Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, Karen has failed the test of the porch. She had to leave.,Lily

4,17, The Front Porch, It's pretty awesome.,Ted

4,17, The Front Porch, You're better off without her.,Marshall

4,17, The Front Porch," You know what? Go ahead, laugh.",Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, Why are you wearing this stuff?,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, Several reasons.,Marshall

4,17, The Front Porch, That was you? It's crazy!,Ted

4,17, The Front Porch, You have made us break up?,Ted

4,17, The Front Porch, I did what I had to do.,Lily
4,17, The Front Porch, You have made us break up?,Ted

4,17, The Front Porch, It's called a shirt.,Barney
4,17, The Front Porch," It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.",Ted

4,17, The Front Porch, I do not like this scenario.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break.,Lily

4,17, The Front Porch, Do not say that.,Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18.

4,17, The Front Porch, The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch," I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?",Barney
4,17, The Front Porch, It says you're great and everything will be fine.,Marshall
4,17, The Front Porch, It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?,Barney

4,17, The Front Porch," Sabotaging our relationship? I must admit that even setting the bar really low for judging friends, Lily really outdid themselves. Clearly, we can not see her again. I know. It's hard, huh?",Karen

4,17, The Front Porch," Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case.",Ted
4,17, The Front Porch," We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone...",Robin
4,17, The Front Porch, Will you be my wife back?,Ted
4,17, The Front Porch," A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!",Robin
4,17, The Front Porch," Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?",Ted
4,17, The Front Porch, Genre?,Robin

5,18, Say Cheese, I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.,Lily

5,18, Say Cheese, The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best!,Lily
5,18, Say Cheese," I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don.

5,18, Say Cheese, If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house!,Marshall

5,18, Say Cheese," Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.",Ted
5,18, Say Cheese," You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese, What are you talking?,Ted
5,18, Say Cheese," You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese," I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese, You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.,Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese," And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical.",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese," I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear.",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese," I just thought we had something special, you know?",Woman
5,18, Say Cheese," Me too. Yeah. But you know, life goes darling.",Marshall

5,18, Say Cheese, They would be if Marshall was not on it.,Barney
5,18, Say Cheese, Cheap Shot. Low blow.,Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese, You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.,Ted
5,18, Say Cheese, This is not true!,Lily
5,18, Say Cheese," Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.",Ted
5,18, Say Cheese," It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese," And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.",Ted
5,18, Say Cheese, And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.,Robin
5,18, Say Cheese," Yeah, but you were beautiful.",Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.,Robin
5,18, Say Cheese," Actually, it was a good evening.",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese, It's true.,Lily
5,18, Say Cheese," Yeah, that was good.",Ted

5,18, Say Cheese," Cool. Fine. One, two...",Man
5,18, Say Cheese," Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film?",Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate.,Marshall

5,18, Say Cheese, Really?,Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, Yeah.,Ted
5,18, Say Cheese," What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks?",Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese, And if you break it?,Ted
5,18, Say Cheese, Come.,Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese, I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo.,Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, I liked you.,Ted
5,18, Say Cheese, We must bring back Amanda.,Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, Really?,Ted

5,18, Say Cheese," Thank you, Lil.",Ted
5,18, Say Cheese, I think Lori's age made him very wise.,Robin
5,18, Say Cheese, It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.,Barney
5,18, Say Cheese, So your aunt Lily called Amanda.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,18, Say Cheese," Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
5,18, Say Cheese," Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.",Ted
5,18, Say Cheese, It's a hole in your jacket?,Robin
5,18, Say Cheese, What? Where?,Barney
5,18, Say Cheese," Now, Marshall!",Ted
5,18, Say Cheese, sh1t!,Robin
5,18, Say Cheese, Names that bitch.,Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, Ann has...? Anna?,Ted
5,18, Say Cheese," No, it was my birthday.",Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, Your brain is too predictable associations.,Marshall
5,18, Say Cheese," Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
5,18, Say Cheese, Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...,Barney
5,17, Of Course, It all started a week ago.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.,Woman
5,17, Of Course, Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, But this is merely a tie.,Woman
5,17, Of Course, It was not my best tie.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," So, right after that, I took her home.",Barney
5,17, Of Course," When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.",Woman
5,17, Of Course," Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.",Barney
5,17, Of Course, Good night.,Woman
5,17, Of Course," What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.",Barney
5,17, Of Course, I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work.,Robin
5,17, Of Course, Thanks to this young woman to my left. This report on how rodent avoided in the subway...,Don
5,17, Of Course, The answer might surprise you. It's all rodents.,Robin
5,17, Of Course," I gotta go, okay? See you soon.",Don
5,17, Of Course, Nice to meet you.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, I do too.,Don
5,17, Of Course," This guy is awesome. It's funny, smart, beautiful. You have him to nab it before someone else.",Marshall
5,17, Of Course, I hope you do not talk to you.,Robin
5,17, Of Course, It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.,Lily
5,17, Of Course," Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.",Marshall
5,17, Of Course," I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.",Barney
5,17, Of Course," It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word ""s*x""?",Ted
5,17, Of Course," I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really s*x, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.",Woman
5,17, Of Course, Continuous. Continues.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Did she used an excuse for physical contact?,Ted
5,17, Of Course, It's the cashmere?,Woman
5,17, Of Course, Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.",Barney
5,17, Of Course, She did it too!,Barney
5,17, Of Course," And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, ""I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? """,Ted
5,17, Of Course," You try this sh1t of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.",Barney
5,17, Of Course," It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.",Woman
5,17, Of Course, Did you just say you got a kid!,Barney
5,17, Of Course, You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.,Woman
5,17, Of Course, Completely.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Or the second. Or the third.,Woman
5,17, Of Course, Of course. Well...,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Or the fourth.,Woman
5,17, Of Course, Just tell me how!,Barney
5,17, Of Course," Excuse me, someone is using this stool?",Barney
5,17, Of Course," If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.",Lily
5,17, Of Course," I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...",Barney
5,17, Of Course, From Robin is Robin.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Listen... You wanna go out on Saturday night?,Don
5,17, Of Course, Saturday night?,Robin
5,17, Of Course, It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes!,Marshall
5,17, Of Course," Don... Listen, it's... it's really nice of you, and you're really great...",Robin
5,17, Of Course," Robin, you okay?",Don
5,17, Of Course," I just have a cold. That's why for my voice.  But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.",Marshall
5,17, Of Course, But what are you doing?,Robin
5,17, Of Course," You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.",Marshall
5,17, Of Course," That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect.",Lily
5,17, Of Course," Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?,Lily
5,17, Of Course, It was my show.,Robin
5,17, Of Course," But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...",Robin
5,17, Of Course," Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, It's good. You want a coffee?,Mike
5,17, Of Course," Absolutely, Mike, great idea.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, You?,Mike
5,17, Of Course, I have not really want right now.,Robin
5,17, Of Course," And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said...",Robin
5,17, Of Course, That's to say?,Robin
5,17, Of Course," Come on, it does not really work, though?",Robin
5,17, Of Course," I knew not what you wanted when I caught you a cappuccino, espresso, latte, decaf... and a Turkish coffee.",Mike
5,17, Of Course," I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.",Robin
5,17, Of Course," This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger.  I put on the StairMaster and...",Barney
5,17, Of Course, It does.,Robin
5,17, Of Course," Spoilers. Regardless, we did.",Barney
5,17, Of Course," I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the shooting range.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, I hope this was not the same nights.,Lily
5,17, Of Course," Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course," You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes.",Lily
5,17, Of Course, She cried? Real tears? It means...,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, Marshall understood what he had been con with Robin.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,17, Of Course," Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. You see, this guy has been very active. Sexually. Finally, it is like that... bang... bang... bang... You see? It's like... bang... bang...",Marshall
5,17, Of Course, How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course," I know, but the song is rather catchy.",Lily
5,17, Of Course, sh1t. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?,Barney
5,17, Of Course, There is another option... but you're not ready.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, Tell me.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.",Ted
5,17, Of Course, A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?,Barney
5,17, Of Course," If you want my help, it's a super hot date.",Ted
5,17, Of Course, Okay.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Let me do it. I will plan everything.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Cutesy and romantic?  No need to take him to Paris or Peru...,Ted
5,17, Of Course, What are you doing?,Barney
5,17, Of Course, They look at us.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, How important it is for you...,Ted
5,17, Of Course, Really? You really gonna do that?,Barney
5,17, Of Course, It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Box strip.,Ted
5,17, Of Course," Finally, the night of the great rencards arrived.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,17, Of Course, Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, I just... I canceled.,Robin
5,17, Of Course, How does it... Wait.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, A problem?,Lily
5,17, Of Course, Robin canceled his hot date.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, What? She was super excited there is one hour.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, Thank you.,Robin
5,17, Of Course, You're excited to go out with Don?,Ted
5,17, Of Course, You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall.,Robin
5,17, Of Course," I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at ""Tombeur panties."" They call it a super hot date.",Ted
5,17, Of Course, Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning!,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, She seemed happy after the break.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course," Wait, but that would mean...",Ted
5,17, Of Course, And I understood what I had been con with Robin.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,17, Of Course, You sing what?,Ted
5,17, Of Course, A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, I'll sing a verse.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, Super.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, Where is she?,Ted
5,17, Of Course, I think it is the toilet.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course," I'm fine, I'm fine.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, Why did you do that?,Barney
5,17, Of Course," Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.",Marshall
5,17, Of Course, Why are you angry against me?,Barney
5,17, Of Course, You were a real asshole to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, You see nothing.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, Typical of a guy.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course," Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.",Lily
5,17, Of Course," What, she is upset?",Barney
5,17, Of Course," Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail.",Lily
5,17, Of Course, Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,17, Of Course, You should have seen.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, I'm going.,Robin
5,17, Of Course, We go back home...,Barney
5,17, Of Course, I can not believe that Robin is upset.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.,Marshall
5,17, Of Course," I did worse after the premiere of ""The Phantom Menace.""It's been like that since we broke up?",Barney
5,17, Of Course," Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.",Lily
5,17, Of Course, I know where.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, I know you're upset.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.",Robin
5,17, Of Course, You sure you're not upset?,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?,Robin
5,17, Of Course, You're not another number for me.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.",Robin
5,17, Of Course," I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?",Barney
5,17, Of Course," Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.",Robin
5,17, Of Course," Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.",Barney
5,17, Of Course, Do not sleep with Anita.,Robin
5,17, Of Course, I promise.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?,Robin
5,17, Of Course, It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,17, Of Course, I wanted to call you.,Barney
5,17, Of Course," I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.",Barney
5,17, Of Course, No.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, No.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, No.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, No.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, No.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Yeah.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, I'm sorry. The answer is no.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, Here is my story.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, I hope so too.,Barney
5,17, Of Course, This is an old story of married women.,Ted
5,17, Of Course, How was this date?,Marshall
5,17, Of Course, Good enough. Pretty... pretty good.,Robin
5,17, Of Course, How so?,Ted
5,17, Of Course," Come on, guys. It was good. It was nice. We spent a pleasant evening. Let... Let him that. Even if...",Robin
8,2, The Pre, But a funny thing happened that night.,Future Ted(Narrator)
8,2, The Pre," But on this one, he may have a point. I mean, look... the idea of renegotiating the terms of the relationship, that's valid.",Marshall
8,2, The Pre, And just like that... one of these four couples would break up the very next day.,Future Ted(Narrator)
8,2, The Pre," Okay,",Lily
8,2, The Pre, Was it really that high?,Robin
8,2, The Pre, Barney's prenup,Robin
8,2, The Pre, The TV happened,Robin
8,2, The Pre, I get... turned on watching myself do the news during s*x.,Robin
8,2, The Pre, Wait.,Lily
8,2, The Pre," There is, little lady. I've got a guest room.",Ted
8,2, The Pre, Oh...,Robin
8,2, The Pre, So we're just here to ensure he doesn't sign anything he'll regret.,Marshall
8,2, The Pre," Hang on a second. ""A half million dollar fine ""any time Mr. Stinson can't 'rise to the occasion,' cue sad slide whistle sounds""?",Barney
8,2, The Pre," Wait, I'm confused.",Barney
8,2, The Pre," Okay, you know what?",Marshall
8,2, The Pre," And for a moment, all felt right with the world.",Future Ted(Narrator)
8,2, The Pre, Ahh...,All
6,16, Desperation Day," Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, Someone knows how to set a mood.,Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day, I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day,"  You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,  Total booty-call.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Private Booty, reporting for duty.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day, That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," It's called class, Ted.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""?",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, ""Stop, Marshall, stop,"" but that's just code for ""harder!""",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," I should explain. On their very first Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily set out to watch Sleepless in Seattle.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day," You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day, What girls?,Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Wow, you sound really lonely.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day,  That's not a thing.,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, That's actually true.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Wait, there's more.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, This won't be.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,"  And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, Jupiter, what are your plans for me? 15 and still unmarried.",Woman
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Please say ""widows.""",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  Trolls.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, ...who could care less about Valentine's Day.,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  Lying trolls.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day, And none was taken until just then.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, I'm getting weird!,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," I call him ""Marshpillow."" And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Hey. How was ""baking cookies"" last night?",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day, That was a tough question. You see...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day, Uh... Is that an overnight bag?,Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day, You brought an overnight bag?,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day, You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,"  We said you were going to have s*x. We didn't say, ""Bring a carry-on.""",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,  So how did Zoey react?,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day, She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,  Were there slippers for the morning?,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day," Not slippers, exactly.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, They're called British morning socks.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, This is such a nice surprise. Marshall will be so happy.,Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," How are you holding up, Judy?",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but... I'm not a lunatic.",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here?",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, I wanted to surprise you.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes.",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," Aw... Anything for my baby bear. Get him out of my house. Take Marshall back to New York with you. Please, I am begging you.",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day, I thought he was here helping you.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," Uh, I'll talk to him.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, God.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to ""bake cookies."" We both knew what that meant.",Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day, We totally did.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, ""Am I ready for this?"" And... the answer is ""yes.""",Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day, They're actually called British morning socks.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, Yeah. Don't get in your own way.,Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day, Right. Okay.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, Oops. Comin' right up!,Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day, What?,Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," Anything else, sweetie?",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," Mom, d-do you want me to leave?",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not!",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day," But, Judy, you said...",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota.",Judy
6,16, Desperation Day, So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.,Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day," Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you.",Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day," Tomorrow night, my place.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years.",Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day, Isn't that great?,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Yeah, if you say so, yeah.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day, What do you mean?,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day," Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,"  See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day," Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Kids, I'm not super proud of what I did next.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day, Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day,"  God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Enchanté. That's French for ""What's with the purple?""",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your ""fiancé"" who no one's ever met.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, Is orange juice okay?,Judy
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Okay, when your ""fiancé"" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  My elbow slipped!,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Marshall, I'm going home.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day, What?,Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day, You have Super Mario Kart?!,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Hell, yeah.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Baby, don't go.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, Please come home soon.,Lily
6,16, Desperation Day,"  So, you were an Olympic gymnast?",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, Silver medal.,Woman
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, That's what my dad said.,Woman
6,16, Desperation Day,"  And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, hi.",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,  Quick question.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, Yeah.,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,  Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,  Sure.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, I love Valentine's Day.,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, We are pitiful.,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,  The worst.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, Although there is one difference between you and me.,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,  What's that?,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day," I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, I know.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day,"  All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, I have no idea what any of those words mean.,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day," Hey, I'm all stretched out!",Woman
6,16, Desperation Day,  Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, Yeah.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day, What?,Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day," Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, Crusts cut off.,Ted
6,16, Desperation Day," Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.",Marshall
6,16, Desperation Day, ...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day, Where are Bev and Anna?,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,  Well...,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  What?,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Well, I think I'm heading out, too.",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,"  What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye.",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day,  Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  What are you talking about?,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,"  No, I don't. She's gross.",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,  Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  Whatever you say.,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Oh, hey, Nora.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  Nora...,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day, Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set.,Zoey
6,16, Desperation Day," Well, that was kind of presumptuous.",Ted
6,16, Desperation Day,"  The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!",Barney
6,16, Desperation Day,"  Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.",Robin
6,16, Desperation Day,  Hap...?,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day," Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here.",Nora
6,16, Desperation Day," And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,16, Desperation Day,  Oh!,Barney
6,16, Desperation Day, You will be avenged.,Nora
6,16, Desperation Day," Baby, you're back.",Lily
6,16, Desperation Day," Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,17, Garbage Island," Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Hey, Ted.",Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island, Hey... There she is. Wow.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island, Wendy the Waitress.,Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island, Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,17, Garbage Island," So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, Not according to her.,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.",Nora
6,17, Garbage Island, You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.",Nora
6,17, Garbage Island, Absolutely.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, How is that a disaster?,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," No, I'm kind of tired.",Nora
6,17, Garbage Island, Absolutely.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Please, Cheese. You like this girl.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," What? Nora? No, I don't.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, You like her. You should call her.,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, Totally.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet?",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, Ted, she doesn't want...",Woman
6,17, Garbage Island," No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, man, this movie is scary.",Zoey
6,17, Garbage Island," I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Actually, I said, ""How's your meat?""",Woman
6,17, Garbage Island, Oh. A little cold.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Gee, wonder why.",Woman
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?",Zoey
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island, You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.,Zoey
6,17, Garbage Island," If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Yeah, he's been really... quiet.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, Like Prince.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, Oh. Ha-wink,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, Excuse me?,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, It's been a while.,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Five weeks, three days by my estimation.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, You should work at a carnival.,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Anyway, we should get going.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Good night. Good night, guys.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, 18 weeks.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, Throw me one? Yeah.,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, I see what's going on.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, Yeah?,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, Nora met a guy. What?!,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, What?,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," But ""L'Amour"" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, I can't sleep.,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, Maybe after this documentary on garbage.,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Man, I am losing my touch.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, I have to save the planet!,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Is it over? I call on top.,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,17, Garbage Island, I'm here to...,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island, Ted. What a surprise. Ted.,Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, Captain. I...,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island,You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.,Captain
6,17, Garbage Island," Pssh, nah...",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island,"But my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out.,Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island," Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island,"Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, Wow.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island,Do you have any idea who it could be?,Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,17, Garbage Island," Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, And that's the last time you saw her.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, That's damn good brandy.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," But morning came, and she was gone.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island, I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this.,Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, Me. I'm the bad guy.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, Damn it! The box!,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Deal. Come on, come on.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, Lily!,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Sorry. Who said anything about an...?,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, Sorry?,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Careful, Robin, I'll do it.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," s*x now, we'll do the foreplay after.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting.",Arthur
6,17, Garbage Island, You did meet Sting.,Man
6,17, Garbage Island," Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million?",Arthur
6,17, Garbage Island," Well, because we can always do more.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Yeah, but I met Sting.",Arthur
6,17, Garbage Island," Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?,Arthur
6,17, Garbage Island," Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen...",Arthur
6,17, Garbage Island, His father just died.,Man
6,17, Garbage Island,...nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement.,Arthur
6,17, Garbage Island, Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Hey, baby.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Yeah?,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Well, I do. I got to find those rings!",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Cwap.,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Hi, I'm here to pick up...",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Hello, Ted.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, To the study?,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island, To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.,Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, Know what?,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island," No, no, no, you can't fire him.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island, You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!,Captain
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island," Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Whoa, ""rapscallion"" may be going a bit far, Ted.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island," But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island," Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.",Captain
6,17, Garbage Island, It's me. You're welcome.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Okay, baby, what gives?",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," All right, Robin, give it to me.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," It's a five, idiot.",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island," ""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?",Robin
6,17, Garbage Island, How am I supposed to see that's a five?,Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, Look how you taped this up...,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",Barney
6,17, Garbage Island, Barney. Go get her.,Robin
6,17, Garbage Island," Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.",Zoey
6,17, Garbage Island, So I'm the bad guy. Great.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.",Zoey
6,17, Garbage Island, If you say so.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.",Zoey
6,17, Garbage Island," Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island, He'll never get to see how I turn out.,Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, What do you mean?,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island," Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",Marshall
6,17, Garbage Island, Meeker doesn't hate you.,Lily
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,17, Garbage Island, Closed. Sorry. Thanks.,Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island, Yeah.,Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island, It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.,Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island," Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him?",Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island," Me, too.",Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island," And the rest, as they say...is history.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,17, Garbage Island," And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.",Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island, Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.,Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?",Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island," No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.",Wendy
6,17, Garbage Island," Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you.  Hello. Marshall.",Ted
6,17, Garbage Island," Hey, Ted.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart,  You wouldn't have to take care of it.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,  Here we go.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. ""With""? I am not ""with"" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart,  I don't know. This will be your second date.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Barney said this a lot.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,18, A Change of Heart," If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Never go out with the same girl more than once.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Then why are you going out with Nora again?,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, There is an exception.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, And it was always the same exception.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,18, A Change of Heart,...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. ",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, no. How long have you been sick?",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, The bed... that's where all the...happens.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Come on, let's get you sorted out.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,18, A Change of Heart, Ah. Thank you.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Good night, Barney.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," Good night, Mommy.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Wow, she nursed you back to health?",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,  What? You told me to meet someone.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Actually, I met him in the park.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, Should have just let you get a dog.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, No.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, Yes!,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," * Bang, bang, bangity bang... *",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," * A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," See, Lily? She was worried.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Ow! Nails, nails!",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Well, now it doesn't.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,18, A Change of Heart," Go on, Doctor.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," This might be a little forward, but do you have a bomb strapped to your chest?",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, What's that like?,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, So is everything okay?,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, I am so sorry.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, Thanks.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," That's exactly what I want, too.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,  And what is he?,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, He's a dog.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, He's totally a dog.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart,  What? You saw him hitting on someone?,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," No, I didn't say, ""He a dawg."" I said, ""He's a dog."" As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, Scooby, you ready?",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Good boy!,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart,  That last one did not happen.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, you're right. He dropped it.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,  He's not a dog.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, You are so playful.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Nice job fetching those.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you ""paws.""",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, How did you meet?,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Tell us the ""tail""",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,"Yes, how did you ""whisker"" off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Did you send her an e-mail, or did you ""collar""?",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to ""flea.""",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel.,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ""ruff.""",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, I bet it was an ""Incredible Journey""""",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, What part of Canada is that? Speak.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, This isn't happening.,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Oh, shoot, dropped my keys.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Hey, guys, this is Nora.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Well, it's still early.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, I had no idea he had a deep down.,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, How many do you want?,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, Three... one of each. You?,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Three. All in an old stone house.,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," Yeah, with ivy growing on it.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, And we must have a pool.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, I really am.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Unbelievable.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, Marshall?,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, You got nothing on me.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, The calzone?,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Checkmate.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Robin.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, The Mr. T dream...,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, I'm lost.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, Ted?,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, The ballet class.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, The 'N Sync concert.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," 1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, Ted. The thermos.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, I do! So be cool!,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Sorry, toots. He's taken.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, So. How do you all know Barney?,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because... Barney don't go to no strip clubs.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, Once?,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, Thermos.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Nope. Not even once.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, Really? So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy.,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, I don't recall.,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, This was a big deal for Barney.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,18, A Change of Heart," I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Not even if she's hot?,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, Not even if her mom's hot.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, I'd love to meet your parents.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home?",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart,  He's not a... Good night.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Kids, it was a big bag of sandwiches.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,18, A Change of Heart, Whoa. Put that away.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, Sandwich brownies?,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, Sandwiches make me hungry.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Truth. Hey. I have a question.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, Yeah?,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," What did Barney mean when he said ""calzone""?",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Guys, I found this on the floor.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?",Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, Scooby got out!,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," Yeah, me, too.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Do you want to come upstairs?,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Can you believe...,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  ""Got out""? What do you mean?",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, It wasn't me.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,  Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.,Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart, Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, I was on the spot. This is your fault.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, My fault?,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," Yeah, with the whole ""I want to get married"" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Good-bye, Barney.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart, Great idea.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart," No, great idea!",Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, Of course. Back to the pizza place!,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.,Ted
6,18, A Change of Heart, Who's Scooby?,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart,"  Hey, have you seen Scooby?",Robin
6,18, A Change of Heart," Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Scooby!,Marshall
6,18, A Change of Heart, Day's not over.,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, What time was your dinner reservation?,Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart," Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.",Lily
6,18, A Change of Heart, I lied.,Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, Barney.,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart, I'm confused.,Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.",Barney
6,18, A Change of Heart," Mom, Dad... this is Barney.",Nora
6,18, A Change of Heart," Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Ted. This is your seduction lounge. s*x swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,  We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you,Ted
6,19, Legendaddy, Why did Barney need an intervention? It all started a few nights earlier.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,19, Legendaddy," Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy,  You call the super for a screwdriver?,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Barney, I... I got your letter.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Dad?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.,Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy,"  ""So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls""?",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy, Really? I seem to recall...,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy, Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.,Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced ""chamma-leeon,"" so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ""ch-aracter"" to admit that.",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy, You want to tussle? Let's tussle.,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy, Marine biologist.,Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Please, no.",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy, So... you want to get pizza later? Or...,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy, I still think about him in the shower.,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy, Where do I begin?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Yeah. I think I need a drink.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Me, too.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Nice order. Up top.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Make a muscle.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, There you go.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Ah!,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy,  Why did you abandon me?,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy, Why'd you wait so long to contact me?,Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy, Do you... get laid a lot?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Big-time. Observe.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, that's cool.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. ,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy,"  Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy, What do you mean?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy,  Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," You have gaps, too, Lily.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy,  You got nothing on me.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,"  Sure, honey. ",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy, You have terrible aim.,Ted
6,19, Legendaddy,  That's not true.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, my God. Barney's dad.",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right?",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," What? No, I... I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help... Barney won't return my calls.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy,"  What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy, That's not what happened.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, I'm not sure how to start this.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Yeah.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, I think I need a drink.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Me, too.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Glen McKenna, neat.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Milk, skim.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Wow.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," The drugs, the alcohol, the women...",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Yes, yes, yes.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, I was out of control.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, *Out of control.*,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word ""furgling."" It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, ""More quiche! More quiche!"" I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Big-time.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son.""",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Why?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy,  We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy, What?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, You're having dinner with him tonight.,Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Are you sure it's not more than that?,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Fine, I'll go.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Awesome. Um, Lily, keys.  I'm literally 11 inches from you.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy, And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy,  Guess now we wait.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,"  What, baby?",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy, You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.,Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy, That's not true.,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy,"  Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy, I'm sorry.,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy, I first noticed it at the bar.,Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Hey, Lily,  Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," It ages well, that's the thing.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, You guys like my new soul patch?,Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Righteous hair tab, brotha.",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. [...]Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,  I love him.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,"  But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, ""do the laundry""",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,  You can't swallow pills.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person.  Right? What?",Robin
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Good slam, Barney.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Got him again.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, You always add too much water to oatmeal.,Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy, You consistently miss at least one belt loop.,Robin
6,19, Legendaddy, It's like I'm blind.,Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,  You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy,"  Aw, honey.",Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.",Marshall
6,19, Legendaddy," Barney, what is going on?",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, This is mine.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, I don't understand.,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Please, just come down and talk to me.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy, Why does that make you so mad?,Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, ""screwed up"" doesn't even begin to describe...",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Can you help me with this?,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.",Jerry
6,19, Legendaddy, Bye.,Barney
6,19, Legendaddy,  Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?,Lily
6,19, Legendaddy," I'm fine. Hey, Ted.",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Yeah, buddy.",Ted
6,19, Legendaddy," You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?",Barney
6,19, Legendaddy," Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Kids, as you know, I was designing Goliath National Bank's new headquarters on the site of this old hotel, The Arcadian. Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face?  She wants it.,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, You guys are in screaming matches all the time.,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant!,Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you hang up.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you hang up.",Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you hang up.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you hang up.",Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you hang up!  No, you hang up.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you hang up.",Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you...  Hold on.  Hello?",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Why would you do that?!,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,I-I thought you'd like it.,Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Who likes that?,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,I like it.,Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Your relationship sounds exhausting.,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, I have to quit.,Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Quit GNB?! Why?,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,I don't think you know what Spain is.,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, It's dinero.,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Where? I want his autograph!,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, It's graduation goggles.,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, What?,Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, The guy who was basically a dog?,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. ",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," It starts with an... ""L?""",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, How can you not remember my name?,Girl
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Well, they don't do that all the time.",Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"Yes, they do.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, they don't.",Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"Yes, they do. It's like they...",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, It rhymes with your name.,Girl
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, And I said my name was...?,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, good for you, sweetie.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?""",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Guys, everything's ruined.",Man
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, What? Why?,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.",Man
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, It's not.,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?""",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, ""Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?""",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, We take turns! Sometimes.,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Hershel?,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Barney, I'm not playing...",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Just come back to GNB already!,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, I'm really loving my new job.,Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Thanks, baby.  Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, That's how I'm gonna use mine.,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. ""Barney, we have to talk about your father."" ""Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil."" ""Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session ""between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute."" I don't need this!",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?  Perfect. Let's go.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"  Oh, my God!",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, How long have you been there?,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, You don't remember?,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, no, I'm fine.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Yeah.,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"Right. So, um... Chinese?",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, But I thought you liked being challenged.,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. ",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.,Man
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Um, he speaks perfect English.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Yeah, I-I know.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Then why did you ask me to come?,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," You were right. If I hear myself say ""Baby, you have my full support"" one more time, I swear I'm gonna murder someone!",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bomb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Lil...,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. ",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," My bag? Oh, no. I got it.",Man
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, There's nothing to talk about.,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," I don't want to talk about it, okay?",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Why not?,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Huh?,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub,"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.  You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, What is wrong with you?,Robin
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, What?,Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily... Lily...",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Ted.,Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Hey! What are you doing here?,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.",Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, This you can be supportive of?!,Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, What is that supposed to mean?,Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend!",Ted
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?",Zoey
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, You're too young. This isn't fair.,Lily
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Yes, of course, of course... anything.",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Eat this meatball sub.,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub, I don't have much time!,Barney
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",Marshall
6,20, The Exploding Meatball Sub," Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",Ted
6,21, Hopeless," Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz kill of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, A drunk audience.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,21, Hopeless, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, This time it was Barney who did the walking.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,21, Hopeless, Bye.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,21, Hopeless," I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Mmm. Your dad?,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless, My dad!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Barney Stinson.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... ""Crazy Jerry""? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, You do not know how right you are.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",Ted
6,21, Hopeless," I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, That's why you brought these guys.,Lily
6,21, Hopeless,No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Improvements?!,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless,Yeah.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",Marshall
6,21, Hopeless,"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Whoo-hoo!,Lily
6,21, Hopeless, Gross!,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless,"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""",Ted
6,21, Hopeless,"Ted, card.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde.""",Ted
6,21, Hopeless,"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Aw, man! Why?",Robin
6,21, Hopeless," I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",Lily
6,21, Hopeless, How good was that movie?,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, And... hence new identities.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, And so Barney's dad finally showed up.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,21, Hopeless," Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.",Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," Lily, his wife.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.",Lily
6,21, Hopeless, That's... a little depressing.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.",Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,Robin
6,21, Hopeless," Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Two, three, four!",Robin
6,21, Hopeless," So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Um, those places shut down a long time ago.",Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, no.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, No shut down, too.",Marshall
6,21, Hopeless, There's Where?,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Where's Where?,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Where's where Was was, isn't it?",Lily
6,21, Hopeless," No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Okay.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, Not Okay. That place is lame.,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?,Robin
6,21, Hopeless, That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," Guys, focus.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Where?,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Not Where. Focus.,Robin
6,21, Hopeless, I thought Focus was closed.,Lily
6,21, Hopeless," No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, So Closed is open.,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," No, Closed is closed.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, I don't know. Third base! Right?,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless," I'll go anyplace, okay?",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, Not Okay. Okay is lame.,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.,Robin
6,21, Hopeless," Guys, shut up.",Lily
6,21, Hopeless," No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Guys, just pick a club, okay?",Marshall
6,21, Hopeless, Not Okay!,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Okay is Lame! Gay bar.,All
6,21, Hopeless," For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lamé.",Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," It's hopeless, isn't it?",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless, I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, I might be allergic to this stamp.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Mila Kunis?!,Lily
6,21, Hopeless," No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?,Man
6,21, Hopeless," Uh... no.  The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, I was trying on the pants.,Man
6,21, Hopeless, Oh. ,Robin
6,21, Hopeless," I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?,Man
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, I should be so lucky.,Man
6,21, Hopeless, Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.,Man
6,21, Hopeless," Mm-hmm. You, too.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Yeah.,Man
6,21, Hopeless," Man, isn't this place great?",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shoots and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.",Lily
6,21, Hopeless, My goodness!,Jerry

6,21, Hopeless," Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.",Lily

6,21, Hopeless, Can you believe it? This is awesome!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Barney, how is that awesome?",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.",Lily
6,21, Hopeless, So our usual wager. Deal.,Lily
6,21, Hopeless," Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," No, of course not. I... I just...",Barney

6,21, Hopeless," Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless," Okay. ""I would have stolen you a whole orchestra."" There. What's the rush?",Ted
6,21, Hopeless," Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?",Robin
6,21, Hopeless," Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.",Ted
6,21, Hopeless," A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, You're a doofus and a half.,Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, At a close-out sale at Dawes.,Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Really? I remember that sale.,Ted
6,21, Hopeless," Hey, Robin.",Ted
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, Ted. Oh, no.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Look what I just bought. Right? Right? ,Ted
6,21, Hopeless," Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great s*x that night. Great s*x.",Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. ,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.,Robin

6,21, Hopeless," All right. Whoa, stop.",Robin

6,21, Hopeless," Yeah. Yeah, just like that.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, You were picturing your crush!,Ted
6,21, Hopeless," Well, somebody had to.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless," Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?",Ted
6,21, Hopeless, Yes.,Robin

6,21, Hopeless," After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, Oh...!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, I just puked on the hood of that... police car! ,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, What?,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, Here you go.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Bottoms up, amigo!",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, But all those crazy things you did.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, A drunk audience.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, Oh...!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, What just happened?,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, I... I just puked on the hood of that... ...police car.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Well, why do all those things?",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," I figured if I showed you what... ""never stop partying"" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever.  Oh, well.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.",Barney

6,21, Hopeless, Congratulations!,Woman
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June.  Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, You would look so totally hot in those.,Woman

6,21, Hopeless," Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?",Marshall
6,21, Hopeless, We need someplace to hide.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Where?,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, Step on it! Jerry...,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Do not step on it.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, The laws are there to protect...,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, This is no time for laws!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Buckle up, Barney.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, I am not going to buckle up!,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, I am your father! You will listen to me!,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless, Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?,Ted
6,21, Hopeless, I won that race. My prize... s*x in the bathroom.,Lily
6,21, Hopeless, And I won that race.,Marshall
6,21, Hopeless," Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.",Lily
6,21, Hopeless," Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",Robin
6,21, Hopeless, Why are you smiling?,Lily
6,21, Hopeless, I don't know. Good night.,Robin
6,21, Hopeless, It wasn't the end of that. More on that later,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,21, Hopeless, And her fiancé? The guy's like a two.,Man
6,21, Hopeless, How did you do it?,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, Do what?,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...",Barney
6,21, Hopeless, You're drifting.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless," When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.",Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless,So how do you do it?,Barney
6,21, Hopeless, A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.,Jerry
6,21, Hopeless,Maybe I've met her already.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless,Maybe some other time.,Barney
6,21, Hopeless," Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.",Jerry
6,21, Hopeless,I'm going fishing with my dad.,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference.",Arthur
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Which made Marshall's big interview with a respected environmental organization all the more confusing.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen... at least I did when he actually showed up.",Arthur
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Your move.,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Screw the environment!,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, yeah. We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent racist.",Arthur
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Sir, none of that is...",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," And so Marshall stormed over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.",Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to ""Hot For Teacher."" Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Dude, that's my girlfriend.",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, You know it.,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Hey, guys.",Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Hey!,All
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down.,Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Yeah, totally.",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," So, they found water on Mars. What?",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, That was on purpose!,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I mean this is really like...,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Barney, please...",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, And thus began an all-out war between Barney and Marshall...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?!",Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Later, back at the bar... another war was just beginning.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Babe, can I get you a drink?",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet.",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I know.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, You know what? Screw this. Game on.,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, The walk-by with the stink eye.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, No. I' was... I was...,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, This went on for days.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. ",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, bye-bye.",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. ",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, boy. Look who's back.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style ""All Night Long""?",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, That's it!,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Kent! Kent!,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," That's what you get, you traitor!",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, really? Really?",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Yeah. Really.,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Really. That... what...,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Okay, enough! You guys are out of here.",Carl
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Ejected!,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out!,Carl
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous.  Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Man, what are we going to do without her?",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Oh...,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Ten, nine, eight...",All
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Happy New Year!,All
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, How about martinis?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Why not?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Every time.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Uh-huh.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," I keep telling you, that didn't happen.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Peppermint schnapps?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Who?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Hey, where are our chicken wings?",Ted

6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing.,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Peace, I'm out.",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Peace. I'm out.,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," You had to take that away from me, didn't you? ",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, What do you mean?,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Stop.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Man, how did things get so screwed up?",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I thought we weren't talking about...,Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?,Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel.",Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Okay.,Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I showed up with wet hair once! Once!,Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, my God.",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow.,Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, That's not a chocolate.,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh God, I didn't even think of that...",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," It made me wonder, ""What could I have done to make him stay?""",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.",Marshall
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.,Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Wow. That got real o'clock.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Dance, my puppets, dance!",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Oh, God, totally!",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me?",Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, This bathroom for entire floor!,Woman
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?,Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?",Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.",Lily
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, What? What is it?,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?,Lily

6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Kids, don't drink tequila.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man.",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty.,Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Okay. What is it? And don't give me, ""It's beautiful."" Don't give me, ""It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?",Ted

6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Why, why have you never told me that?",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too.",Zoey
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, I love you.,Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," I love you, too.",Zoey

6,22, The Perfect Cocktail, We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.,Robin
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...",Barney
6,22, The Perfect Cocktail," Okay, what drink can fix this?",Robin

7,2, The Naked Truth, What happened to your leg?,Lily
7,2, The Naked Truth," Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?",Barney

7,2, The Naked Truth, A one-man show... I love it!,Barney
7,2, The Naked Truth, Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?,Lily
7,2, The Naked Truth," You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.",Barney

7,2, The Naked Truth, There is no club.,Marshall
7,2, The Naked Truth, There he is just a troublemaker.,Pete
7,2, The Naked Truth," It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand.",Marshall

7,2, The Naked Truth," Oh, God...",Pete
7,2, The Naked Truth," Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why?

7,2, The Naked Truth, Pete has a small dick?,Ted
7,2, The Naked Truth," I have no idea. Well, what do you take?",Lily

7,2, The Naked Truth," But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, ""Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! """,Lily
7,2, The Naked Truth, Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!,Barney
7,2, The Naked Truth," Barney, what are you doing here?",Robin

4,8, Woooo!," Oh, my God. At school, she is so calm and normal. I thought it was not... a Woo.",Lily
4,8, Woooo!," What is Woo? Let me explain. Woo is a kind of a young woman, who, like the cuckoo and the nightingale, takes its name from its singular it produces. Also, a Woo can be triggered in different ways. On one particular song on the jukebox...",Future Ted(Narrator)

4,8, Woooo!," Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.",Ted
4,8, Woooo!," Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless.",Barney

4,8, Woooo!, None of this stuff...,Lily
4,8, Woooo!," Industry shooters memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys.

4,8, Woooo!, Wooo!,All

4,8, Woooo!, The Board... Sven decided to choose.,Barney
4,8, Woooo!, I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?,Ted
4,8, Woooo!, I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry.,Barney
4,8, Woooo!, It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.,Ted
4,8, Woooo!," You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it?",Marshall
4,8, Woooo!, I think I need it.,Ted
4,8, Woooo!, Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine.,Barney

4,8, Woooo!, Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day.,Lily

4,8, Woooo!, It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free.,Barney
4,8, Woooo!, Teleconference. Now.,Marshall
4,8, Woooo!, You wanna tell me something?,Marshall
4,8, Woooo!, Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk.,Barney

4,8, Woooo!, It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.,Barney
4,8, Woooo!, You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.,Marshall

4,8, Woooo!, I have not even paid attention.,Barney
4,8, Woooo!, How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.,Marshall
4,8, Woooo!," I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons.",Barney
4,8, Woooo!," No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.",Marshall

4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Go outside, go, go.",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Okay. ,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Leave the bat.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Fine.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, And there it was.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Name two places where things get stuffed.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," So, I went inside.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Ted, you got to wake up. Wake...",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, You couldn't find it?,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Where do you think it was?,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Probably tucked between her legs.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I couldn't help but overhear.,Man
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Okay, here we go.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I know the place you're talking about.,Man
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," No, you don't.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, It's a place called the Corner Bistro. Greatburger.,Man
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, But none of those places even came close.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, No.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," No. No, we don't know where it is.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," OK, Regis, we will, we will.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, All right.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says ""Burger.""",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Green door, red neon sign that says ""Burger?""",Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Yeah.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.",Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I knew it was on a numbered street!,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Finally.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, No...,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, We should probably call Regis.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Reg...  That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York,Let's just go inside then. Shall we?,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York,Yours will be right out.,Wendy
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Please, go ahead, start.",Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Just shut up and eat.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, All right.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I think I just had my first burg-asm.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, It's not it.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I mean, it is just a burger.",Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive ""pas de deux"". And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says ""Burger"". I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Tell them about the underpants.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, What about the underpants?,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, It started a couple of weeks ago.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Hey, baby.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Hey!,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Did you put on pants today?,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Nope. They laugh.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, ""Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that."" Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, How big is Marshall's underpants radius?,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, We're going.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. ""We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank."" Member FDIC.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, We've got to find Marshall that burger.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I'm not eating that burger.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Finally.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and ""Burger"" sign.",Wendy
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, What? Uptown? Where?,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, 106th and Manhattan Avenue.,Wendy
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Damn it.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, 106. A numbered street. Of course.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Barney Stinson.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I'm sorry, this is...?",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Onions?,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Okay, no onions.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Stop the cab!,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Wait. This is it.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, This is it.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," One of 9,000 convenient locations.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I don't understand. Where is the burger place?,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, We can't eat here. It's an ATM.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, But... food.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, What the...,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Marshall, Geez.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," They suck, suck!",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Will you just tell her already?,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Tell me what? Tell me what?,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I got a job.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, What? Where?,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, But you want to be an environmental lawyer.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, You've got great pants.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I love you.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I love you.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Robin, no!",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, They're unopened.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Give it.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, They're barbecue.,Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Give it!,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks.",Man
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Let's pay the man.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I paid for the cab.,Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I have any cash.,Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, I haven't worked since March.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.",Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Member FDIC.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later...",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, Thank you.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?",Ted
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, This is it.,Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," And so, after finally tasting again the burger he'd craved for so many years, Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants, and went to work, and he never looked back.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there.",Lily
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.",Robin
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.,Barney
4,2, The Best Burger in New York," If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.",Marshall
4,2, The Best Burger in New York, That's outrageous.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, a tramp stamp?!,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," kids, too often in life, we make decisions that we're not prepared to live with.  This is a story about those decisions, and the consequences that follow. ",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Say goodbye, kids, 'cause it won't be around much longer. ",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," oh, but Ted, if you get rid of the butterfly, how's everyone gonna know you're a stripper fron reno with daddy issues?",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule," yes, yes, enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions, Stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Stella?,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, what?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I asked her out.,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Ted, why would you do that?",All
3,11, The Platinum Rule, what's matter with you?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, What? What do you mean?,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Dude... don't poop where you eat.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," oh, no, this doesn't count.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," If it's someone you see on a regular basis, and you can't avoid them...",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts.",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule," You've heard of the golden rule, right? ""love their neighbor?""",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," uh, actually, it's ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's from the bible.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me...",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Wait, Ted, Barney has a point. Remember what happened with me and curt down at the station?",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, It's true.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, That's not even possible.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, 12 of them.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, There's no way.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Here's your gin and tonic.,Wendy
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Thanks.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Oh, hi, welcome to the building. Yeah.",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, We love brunch!,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, yeah!,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Oh, welcome. You look really familiar. Are you a former athlete?",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them. Idiots! But still, you think, ""this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me."" And that step 2! Bargaining.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," NO! no, no, don't do it!",All
3,11, The Platinum Rule," I know, i know but he used to play hockey, and i'm canadian. I can't help it. If he were missing some teeth, i probably would have already hit that.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Robin, it's a mistake. Remember what happened with me and Marshall? The Gerards across the hall?",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Michael and LAura. They're awesome. We're gonna invite them over for dinner.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule," This is NYC.You don't get close to the neighbors. You nod at them politely in the hall. You call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, That's the couples version of dating.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I don't know. I'd expect you to have one already.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Barney, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to kill the bar.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Bar killer.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Don't kill the bar, dude.",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," yeah, well, i think it'll be okay.",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, And it was a huge mistake.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, You have a butterfly tramp stamp.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Good night!,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?,Wendy
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Not at all.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Want to have dinner with us tonight?,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, That was an intersting use of the beverage gun.,Wendy
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Club soda can get anything off.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!",Wendy
3,11, The Platinum Rule," hey, can i get a gin and tonic?",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," oh, i paid for it.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, What the opposite of name-dropping?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, That's what we thought.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, And it's so conveniant. They're right across the hall. Say it's sunday and we want to have a brunch double date with someone.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, We just go across the hall.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, And say we want to have a dinner party exploring the wine and cuisine of France's Loire Valley.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, We just go across the hall.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Say we want to play a game of charades...,Lily

3,11, The Platinum Rule, This bar is like home to us.,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, You're killing the bar.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I'm not killing the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling.  It's fiiine.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, It's fine.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, It's fine.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, But it wasn't.,Robin

3,11, The Platinum Rule, Don't do this Ted. Don't ,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," God, i'm such an idiot.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, yeah.,Marshall

3,11, The Platinum Rule, I remember that.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Ro! we are such idiots!,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Yeah!,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are.",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them?,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," ""Hey neighbor!"" ""Hey, neighbor""""Hey neighbor.""",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I remember that.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, oh you are kidding me?! What?!,All
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Don't kill the bar dude!,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, tss ,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Well, we love this bar. You can't dump her. Marry her if you have to.",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Wendy the waitress hyphen Stinson.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, don't kill the bar dude.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Curt, we need to talk. I like you...",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," guys, we like you a lot...",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I don't like you.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade.",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, We're getting a little sick of charades.,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule," I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?",Wendy
3,11, The Platinum Rule, or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," And now, here's Curt ""the iron man"" irons with sports. Curt?  Curt?",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Uh, well, their perimeter shooting has been a little bit off this season...",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, And that's sports.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Do you see anything?,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I think we're clear.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, ok go go go. ,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, That was close.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Too close.  You've got to be kidding me. What do we do?,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I have no idea. ,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," guys, are you here? I forgot my keys. Can you open up?",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, It's just Ted!,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Hello? Guys? ,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Baby, we only have one choice.",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Okay, hurry!  Michael and Laura are probably...",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends.",Wendy
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," If you need anything else, let me know.",Wendy
3,11, The Platinum Rule, waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, She's gonna try to kill me. This is poisoned.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, What? You're being ridiculous.,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to kill me and everyone close to me.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, What are you talking about?,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says ""no hard feelings"". She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Where did Marshall get that hamburger?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Dude.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, You're welcome.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?",Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Yet.,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, You're an idiot.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," All right, i'm taking off.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, What?,Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule, I have a date. ,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, You're such a jerk!,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," So what do you mean ""it wasn't a date""?",Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Why would she think that?,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.",Barney
3,11, The Platinum Rule," No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.",Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," Oh, sorry Ted.",Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, It's okay. What are you guys watching?,Ted
3,11, The Platinum Rule," So that was the end of the story between me and Stella, at least for the time being. But i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule, i think there's a ninth step. We'll call it coexistence. It's the moment you realize that all that anger and resentment just isn't useful.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Thanks for watching.,Robin
3,11, The Platinum Rule, and you start to let go of it.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,11, The Platinum Rule, So what do you guys have going on tonight?,Lily
3,11, The Platinum Rule, Have fun.,Marshall
3,11, The Platinum Rule, And move on with your life.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,11, The Platinum Rule, It just takes a while.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns, There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.",Ted
2,13, Columns, I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.,Ted
2,13, Columns," Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns, Stairs?,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns, Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.,Ted
2,13, Columns, But suddenly I was a different guy.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Hey, guys. What's so funny?",Ted
2,13, Columns, Thanks.,Ted
2,13, Columns, The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.",Robin
2,13, Columns," Before, I used to be this guy.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.",Ted
2,13, Columns, But now...I was this guy.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work.",Ted
2,13, Columns," But still, the worst part was Druthers.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Well, I was thinking...",Ted
2,13, Columns," Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.",Robin
2,13, Columns, Why would you say that?,Ted
2,13, Columns," Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.",Robin
2,13, Columns, I have found that to be true.,Barney
2,13, Columns, It's a blessing and a curse really.,Marshall
2,13, Columns," Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.",Lily
2,13, Columns," Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?",Marshall
2,13, Columns, Tony.,Ted
2,13, Columns, Angela.,Robin
2,13, Columns, Mona.,Barney
2,13, Columns, Mona?,Robin
2,13, Columns, Watch it more closely. Rock your world.,Barney
2,13, Columns," So, what are you gonna do?",Robin
2,13, Columns," Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.",Ted
2,13, Columns, You mind if I charge my phone?,Barney
2,13, Columns, Knock yourself out.,Ted
2,13, Columns," Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?",Robin
2,13, Columns, You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.,Ted
2,13, Columns," Oh, my God! ",Barney
2,13, Columns, What?,Ted
2,13, Columns, Do you know about this?,Barney
2,13, Columns, No.,Ted
2,13, Columns, What is that?,Robin
2,13, Columns," Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.",Barney
2,13, Columns," Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.",Ted
2,13, Columns," I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.",Barney
2,13, Columns," Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.",Robin
2,13, Columns," Oh, come on, Robin.",Barney
2,13, Columns," No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.",Robin
2,13, Columns, I know! We're gonna have so much fun!,Barney
2,13, Columns," Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Oh, you had me. You so had me.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," So, you didn't fire him?",Robin
2,13, Columns," I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.",Barney
2,13, Columns," Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.",Marshall
2,13, Columns," And, uh... I... got you a rose.",Robin
2,13, Columns, Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.,Marshall
2,13, Columns," Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.",Barney
2,13, Columns," Oh, wow, a new dart.",Robin
2,13, Columns," Hey, that new dart is great.",Ted
2,13, Columns," I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.",Robin
2,13, Columns," Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art.",Barney
2,13, Columns,  Nude art.,Ted
2,13, Columns,  Nude art.,Robin
2,13, Columns," Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?",Marshall
2,13, Columns, I knew this day would come.,Lily
2,13, Columns, How did you know that?,Marshall
2,13, Columns, Because I didn't hide it very well.,Lily
2,13, Columns," So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.",Marshall
2,13, Columns," It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.",Lily
2,13, Columns, The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!,Marshall
2,13, Columns," No, he's actually a little husky...",Lily
2,13, Columns," Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.",Marshall
2,13, Columns," Okay, just forget it.",Lily
2,13, Columns," Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.",Marshall
2,13, Columns," Well, then you'll have to do it.",Lily
2,13, Columns, Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?,Marshall
2,13, Columns, We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.,Lily
2,13, Columns, We totally saw your butt.,Barney
2,13, Columns, This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.,Marshall
2,13, Columns," Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?",Barney
2,13, Columns, Where is it?,Marshall
2,13, Columns, I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.,Barney
2,13, Columns," You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?",Marshall
2,13, Columns," Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?",Barney
2,13, Columns, Field trip!,Ted
2,13, Columns," Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.",Barney
2,13, Columns," Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?",Carl
2,13, Columns," What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!",Marshall
2,13, Columns," Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.",Carl
2,13, Columns, I know that Barney gave you that painting.,Marshall
2,13, Columns, I don't know what you're talking about.,Carl
2,13, Columns," Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.",Marshall
2,13, Columns, I doubt it.,Carl
2,13, Columns," Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.",Marshall
2,13, Columns, I doubt it.,Carl
2,13, Columns," All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.",Marshall
2,13, Columns, I doubt it.,Carl
2,13, Columns, This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.,Marshall
2,13, Columns," Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?",Robin
2,13, Columns," Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...",Barney
2,13, Columns," One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.",Robin
2,13, Columns," You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.",Lily
2,13, Columns," Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.",Barney
2,13, Columns, Are you serious?,Lily
2,13, Columns, Yeah.,Barney
2,13, Columns," Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?",Lily
2,13, Columns, Paint me.,Barney
2,13, Columns, What?,Lily
2,13, Columns, Paint me.,Barney
2,13, Columns," Hammond, is that you?",Ted
2,13, Columns, Mosby?,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?",Ted
2,13, Columns, What are you doing?,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns, I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?,Ted
2,13, Columns," Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...",Ted
2,13, Columns, Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns, It's okay.,Ted
2,13, Columns, What did you want to say to me?,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?",Ted
2,13, Columns, Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Yeah, I do.",Ted
2,13, Columns, Cause I design homes.,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns, I see it.,Ted
2,13, Columns, But I don't have a home.,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Uh, no, I don't.",Ted
2,13, Columns," If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Well, that's the dream.",Ted
2,13, Columns," I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Me too, Hammond.",Ted
2,13, Columns, Call me Ham.,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," No, thanks.",Ted
2,13, Columns, Hammy D?,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," No, I think just Hammond.",Ted
2,13, Columns," So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.",Robin
2,13, Columns, I was this close.,Ted
2,13, Columns," Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Oh honey, you're awake?",Lily
2,13, Columns, I'm awake. Is everything okay?,Marshall
2,13, Columns, Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?,Lily
2,13, Columns," Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.",Marshall
2,13, Columns," Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?",Lily
2,13, Columns," It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.",Marshall
2,13, Columns," Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?",Lily
2,13, Columns, Loch Ness?,Marshall
2,13, Columns," Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...",Lily
2,13, Columns," Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.",Marshall
2,13, Columns, Maybe we can.,Lily
2,13, Columns, Paint me.,Barney
2,13, Columns," Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?",Lily
2,13, Columns," We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.",Barney
2,13, Columns," Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.",Lily
2,13, Columns," Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.",Barney
2,13, Columns, Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.,Lily
2,13, Columns," I'll give you $5,000.",Barney
2,13, Columns, We're going to Loch Ness!,Marshall
2,13, Columns, Yeah!,Lily
2,13, Columns, That cabby would not shut up.,Ted
2,13, Columns," Yeah, we should call him a gabby.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," I think it, you say it.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.",Ted
2,13, Columns, What?,Ted
2,13, Columns," You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns, Can I see you for one second?,Ted
2,13, Columns," Ooh, I'm in trouble now.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.",Ted
2,13, Columns, We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my",Ted
2,13, Columns," Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Okay, let's get this over with.",Lily
2,13, Columns," Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.",Barney
2,13, Columns, Thank you.,Lily
2,13, Columns," I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong.",Barney
2,13, Columns, I don't think your sword will fit.,Lily
2,13, Columns, I get that a lot.,Barney
2,13, Columns," And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns, This isn't right. This isn't right at all.,Marshall
2,13, Columns," Finally, he could take it no more.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns, Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!,Lily
2,13, Columns, Paint faster!,Barney
2,13, Columns," Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.",Lily
2,13, Columns," Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...",Barney
2,13, Columns," Oh, just drop them!",Lily
2,13, Columns, All right.,Barney
2,13, Columns," No! No, this is not right!",Marshall
2,13, Columns, We had a deal!,Barney
2,13, Columns," Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!",Marshall
2,13, Columns, You...!,Barney
2,13, Columns," It's over! .  Lily, I can't let you go through with this!  I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand.  It's just not right! . It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.",Marshall
2,13, Columns," Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.",Barney
2,13, Columns,  We accept.,Marshall
2,13, Columns," You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.",Barney
2,13, Columns, And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,13, Columns," Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...",Ted
2,13, Columns, Looking for Hammond Druthers.,Man
2,13, Columns," Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns, These are divorce papers. You've been served.,Man
2,13, Columns," Oh, God.",Ted
2,13, Columns, She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.,Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," There is no easy way to say this, but...",Ted
2,13, Columns," She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...",Ted
2,13, Columns, You've got to be kidding me!,Ted
2,13, Columns," Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Wait, his birthday was yesterday!",Ted
2,13, Columns," Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought...",Man
2,13, Columns," No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?",Ted
2,13, Columns," Oh, God...",Mr Druthers
2,13, Columns," Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired!  In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.",Ted
2,13, Columns," Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss.",Man
2,13, Columns," Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.",Lily
2,13, Columns," Thank you very much, Lily.",Barney

2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Candy.,Marshall

2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Ted, what is wrong with you?",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Lily.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, It is a great ass.,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," None of us had seen Lily in three months. There were so many unanswered questions, so many things to say.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Your hair is adorable!,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Thank you! ,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Hi. Have you met Marshall?,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Hi.,Woman
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Umm... I guess. . Oh my God!  Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!",Woman
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You went home with her!,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, really?",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, come on. Does that really work?",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You've gotta hear this.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You will not believe what just happened.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You go first.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Lily is back in town.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today.",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, How is she doing?,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You're not gonna like it.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, the art program, best thing ever.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. .",Man
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah!,Woman
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Wow, I am so happy for you.",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You never chose sides. I respect that.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Uh, listen Marshall...",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Way to go.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, She's moved on?,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Excellent. Have you chosen your entrée?,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on.",Girl
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Nice recovery. I think it's working.,Barney

2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I hate you.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I know but tonight...,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," No, forget it. You're such a jackass!",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," OK, but no magic. . How did you do that?",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Yeah.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, What?,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy.",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Trust me, I'm a girl!",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Yeah. But you're Canadian.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Why do you always have to bring that up?,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You're our weird neighbors!,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You bring it up every time...,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You're on.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Five American bucks.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Marshall Eriksen, suit up!",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, No way.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Come on...,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Sleeves.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, There is nothing in my sl...,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Oh is that right?,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Huh? Huh? Let's go.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Behind my ear.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Ohh!,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's killing me though.",Girl
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does kill you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again.",Girl
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Yes, it would. It really would.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Maybe I'll see you here sometimes.,Girl
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Probably not. I'm never here, so...",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," You know, I do have a phone number.",Girl
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Great. Nice.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Hi, I'm Barney.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, no.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Sure.,Girl
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I'm not giving you...,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Terrific.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," That is so good to hear. . Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. .",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. .,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! ,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Stop it!,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You don't want to see me when I'm angry!,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. .",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Stop the cab! ,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. . Oh, she does have a cute handwriting.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Gravy.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Surprise me.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, What are you charpy about?,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, She's still drunk from last night.,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I don't think so! Whoo!,Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," But it's good, I mean work's great...",Robin
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now?  Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask!  And, hey, how is Marshall?",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, But I thought your summer was great?!,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Not exactly...,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything.,Man
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?,Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Yeah, um...",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.,Man
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Wow. So, maybe I should call him?",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word ""maybe"". ""Maybe"" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.",Ted
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Hi Marshall.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," There is no ""would"" in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, That's not possible.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, A twin isn't the same person.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Of course, it is. What do you think ""identical"" means? ""Ident-"" - same. ""-ical"" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Fine.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Ah!,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, How are you doing?,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, But they're twins.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Ted's my best friend.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad,"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. . Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.,Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Lily. What are you doing here?,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, I know. It was the worst summer of my life.,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Can we please get back together?,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," All that crap you said to me about ""we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own."". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Can we please get back together?,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?,Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. . And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad, Yeah.,Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.",Marshall
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," So then, I was promoted to assistant ménage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that?  Lily?",Barney
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! ",Lily
2,2, The Scorpion and the Toad," So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant ménage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," What do you mean ""could""?",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Trust that impulse, Ted.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, A... LAME-A?,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Yes! Word up!,All
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, put me down for two.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Really? It's three months away.,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yes, that's what I meant by ""you know."" I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, That's only two.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Count again.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, So get an escort.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Why not?,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Because... gross?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You really think that's true?,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Yes.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You just made that up.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Withdrawn.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, 57 days.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Is that your water? May I?,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, go ahead.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I said good day!,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, What?,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You okay?,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Ted's still coming to this thing, right?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Yep.,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No, it's not going to be weird at all.  Robin's bringing a date.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Boy. That's going to be really weird.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I know.,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Robin's bringing a date.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Dude, it's going to be weird.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, it won't be weird.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Thank you.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Because you're going to bring your own date.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Hello, Barney.",Woman
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, What the hell?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, 500 bucks?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Check out Robin's date.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I know.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Is that who I think it is?,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One, the most low-budget cable news network ever.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Sandy time. Sandy time!,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," He was best known for his morning segment ""In Today's Paper,"" during which he literally flipped through today's papers, reading them aloud to viewers.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Here we have, on the front page, a story about a... I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building. Looks interesting.",Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p0rn star Sandy...?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yosemite Sandy, definitely.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Excellent choice. I love this guy.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I hate this guy.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Hey.,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I'm Lily.,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Hey.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Hi.,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You look nice.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.,Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Starting a bunch of office rumors? Looks that way. Looks that way.,Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? ""Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have s*x for money.""",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Who has s*x for money?,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Lily, you okay?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.,Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," ""Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.""",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Well, it's just an internship, for the record.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Exactly. Thank you, Mary.",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," So, Mary, what do you do for a living?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, She's a paralegal.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, what firm?",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, That's a real law firm.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Nice.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You're pretty good on your feet.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Is that allowed?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You're welcome.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You got me. What do you do, Ted?",Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.,Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize, this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Hey.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, We're still friends.,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, so now she's a whore?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, What?,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I like that guy.,Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Hey.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Hey. What were you guys talking about over there?,Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.",Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Sleep with a prostitute?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You just made that up.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Withdrawn.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, well... there we go.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Congratulations.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Sure. Let's go.,Sandy
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, What's it look like?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, that's real mature.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Good night.,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," So, did you and Barney ever...?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, thank God.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I put him in a cab.,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, So you and he aren't...?,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, He's off trying to make you jealous.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, What?!,Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Barney paid for her.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Is that true?,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?",Robin
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!",Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, That's her napkin.,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, No!,Lily
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, What?,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, So she's not...?,Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I feel kind of like Richard Gere.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," You know, been... on a ""date.""",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No. Why, is that so odd?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Must be tough.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," No, you're a hooker.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, You're a paralegal.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, That was not funny.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Not funny, dude.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," I know, it was hilarious.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Why would you do that?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, I did it to prove a point.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, What point?,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.",Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, She slapped me and stormed off.,Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.,Barney
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.",Marshall
1,19, Mary the Paralegal," Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.",Ted
1,19, Mary the Paralegal, Your room?,Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement, there occurred a game-changing emergency.",Future Ted(Narrator)

1,20, Best Prom Ever," No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Todd and Valerie?,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple.",Future Ted(Narrator)

1,20, Best Prom Ever, You're a wonder.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, How are you going to get everything done?,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Was it...?,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Lil, you know I can't promise that.",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Who?,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," John ""Bonzo"" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Well, then... I have to say no.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Let me check their Website.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, What?,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?",Lily

1,20, Best Prom Ever, A prom? Can... can we go to that?,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah. No, they won't.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Why not?,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, 'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," No sweat, we'll just sneak in.",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever, We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yes, we are. It's the only way.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.",Lily

1,20, Best Prom Ever, I'll go with you.,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Really?,Lily

1,20, Best Prom Ever, Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?,Lily

1,20, Best Prom Ever," Hey, why don't we all go?",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Yeah.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," 'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," All right, what do you think?",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Horrible.,Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever, You're gonna make such a great dad.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, All right.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, I didn't know I still had this.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, What?,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, The dress I wore to my actual prom.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.,Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Aw. Sweet. Thank you.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," No. I've never been to prom before, okay?",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, We got to go. See ya.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Bye, have fun. See you.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," So, what, we ready for tonight?",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Shot of Jim Beam?,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Yeah.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Yes!,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, What?!,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Is this gonna work?,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Hey, ho, hey!",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Wow. ""Ma'am?"" Check and mate.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, For free.,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Hi. Shall we?,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.,Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever, We're in!,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Oh, you're kidding me.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play ""Good Feeling"" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play ""Good Feeling"" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.",Man
1,20, Best Prom Ever, My phlegm feels looser.,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, You know it.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," I'd have your back, too.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, That's cool.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Okay, Ted.  Hello.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for ""Good Feeling"" and bring it out here, like, now.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, What'd she say? What'd she say?,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, What?,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Well, we did promise them one dance.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," No, you won't.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?""",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Okay.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," What's it to you, giant turtle?",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Oh, hey. Where's Lily?",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, She's in the bathroom.,Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Wait here, I should go talk to the band.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, All right.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, How did you guys get in here?,Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever, We just snuck in the back.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.,Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever, But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily?",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Marshall.,Man
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Yeah.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever, It works.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Violent Femmes. I love this song.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Me, too.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Yeah.,Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah. So field hockey, huh?",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever, Shut up.,Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, I totally could have taken that kid.,Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Well, I don't need it, but thanks.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever, So how was your first prom?,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever," So, basically, it was a prom.",Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.",Robin
1,20, Best Prom Ever, I'll take what I can get.,Ted
1,20, Best Prom Ever," And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.",Barney
1,20, Best Prom Ever," So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.",Marshall
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Yeah, it's good.",Lily
1,20, Best Prom Ever," Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, And things were back to normal... Almost.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,8, Atlantic City," You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, uhm...",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Really?,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Of course, I love you.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? ""Do you still wanna?"" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," No, no, no, no, no, no.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, What?!,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Do you remember your proposal to me? ,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, I had a speech prepared.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, What do you want to hear?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Marshall... You are good-looking...,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Thank you.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Funny...,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, thanks.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Smart...,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, And a few tears wouldn't hurt.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, right. ",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," I know, I know.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,8, Atlantic City," Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Yeah...,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Robin! Stop the news!,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, What the hell?,Woman
2,8, Atlantic City, It's okay. They're my friends.,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight.  Hey, Mike... You can read, right?",Woman
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, I'm the best at reading.",Mike
2,8, Atlantic City, Let's go to Atlantic City!,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, Yeah!,All
2,8, Atlantic City," You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Yeah!,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, You got it.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Hey, guys.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, Wow. A pedicure.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, So are you in or not?,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," No, we got to get going to the...",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,8, Atlantic City, Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, You been here before?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, uh, once or twice.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, I'm ready. Let's get married.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, really? Thanks.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Done. ,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. ,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, You guys want to go gamble?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," No, we got to go get the veil.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, okay.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. ",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Thanks.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, How are you feeling?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Great, a little nervous.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Yeah? Craps?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Not that nervous.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," No, I mean do you want to play craps.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, yeah, definitely.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, What did you just say?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Barney, no.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Marshall, I'm your best man.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, You're not my best man.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Right here.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, You're not my best friend.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Right here.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, 18 minutes...,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Of course.,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Dude!,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Unbelievable!,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Your last lap dance ever.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Right. What?,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Does it smell like strippers in here?,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Hell, yeah, look at this. ",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Hi. We're here to get married.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.,Woman
2,8, Atlantic City, We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?",Woman
2,8, Atlantic City," Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.,Woman
2,8, Atlantic City," No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.",Woman
2,8, Atlantic City," Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.",Woman
2,8, Atlantic City, Have you been outside?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",Woman
2,8, Atlantic City," Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Twenty-seven.,Woman
2,8, Atlantic City, Is there any way that we could get a license today?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.",Woman
2,8, Atlantic City," Well, we're in love.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, What better reason could there be?,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," The last one I heard was, ""I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"" but, you know, give yours a whirl.",Woman
2,8, Atlantic City, So we went to the courthouse.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,8, Atlantic City," God, this is taking forever.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Ted, up here.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, Uhm?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, You were just staring at my shirt boobs.,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Hi.,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, See you.,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, What the hell was that?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, A... Chinese guy?,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, really?!",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Really?!,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Why are you doing this to us?!,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Really?!,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, You know what? We get it.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Vultures.,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, What? Here?,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, Yeah. Got a little time to kill.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, No. A little.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Something is seriously wrong with you.,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," So what, is that a no?",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," All right, let's do it.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," All right. Um, also...?",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Yes, I'll leave it on.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, Sweet.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Okay. May we please get married today?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, What was what?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, A look of love.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," You know, what's thick? what's thin?",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, I have.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," No, we're not.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, we are. He's a judge.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go.  Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, This is my machine.,Woman
2,8, Atlantic City, I should go talk to her.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," No, let me.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, Blackjack?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Yeah.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Nobody's gonna do that.,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, What?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.",Captain
2,8, Atlantic City, What?,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, I can get us that money.,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, How?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,8, Atlantic City, Do you understand what's happening?,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Not a clue.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Do you think he's winning?,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City, I don't even know if he's playing.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Wait, I get it. I understand this game.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," No, you don't.",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, Wow. It's beautiful.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Thanks, Barney.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City," When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?",Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, Why can't I do it just a little?,Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, Okay. Let's get this started.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?",Captain
2,8, Atlantic City," You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.",Captain
2,8, Atlantic City," Yeah, serious is probably good.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," ""We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...""",Captain
2,8, Atlantic City, This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," I never said ""never.""",Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," ""...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you."" What was that?",Captain
2,8, Atlantic City, What was what?,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, That little look. You two just shared a look.,Captain
2,8, Atlantic City, We don't want to do this.,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, We don't.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City, After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,Robin
2,8, Atlantic City," Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",Barney
2,8, Atlantic City, You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?,Ted
2,8, Atlantic City," Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City," I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City," I love you, too, Lilypad.",Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, I now pronounce you man and wife.,Captain
2,8, Atlantic City, What?!,Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, Is that not right?,Captain
2,8, Atlantic City, Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.,Marshall
2,8, Atlantic City, Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.,Captain
2,8, Atlantic City," All right, I unpronounce you man and wife.",Captain
2,8, Atlantic City," Oh, whew... That was close.",Lily
2,8, Atlantic City, And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily got married for 12 seconds somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,8, Atlantic City, Hey... Ted.,Marshall
1,21, Milk," And for the birthday boy, lasagna.",Wendy
1,21, Milk, Thank you.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Careful. The plate is very hot.,Wendy
1,21, Milk," 'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
1,21, Milk," All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?",Ted
1,21, Milk," Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.",Robin
1,21, Milk," I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.",Barney
1,21, Milk," You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Oy, gevalt.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.",Barney
1,21, Milk, Whoo-hoo!,Ted
1,21, Milk," Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.",Barney
1,21, Milk, What?,Woman
1,21, Milk, Oh! Call an ambulance!,Barney
1,21, Milk, What's going on?,Woman
1,21, Milk," Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.",Barney
1,21, Milk, Is she okay?,Wendy
1,21, Milk," I'm serious, call 911.",Barney
1,21, Milk, What's wrong? What's the matter?,Woman
1,21, Milk," Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!",Barney
1,21, Milk," You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.",Robin
1,21, Milk, Wait for it.,Ted
1,21, Milk," 28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.",Lily
1,21, Milk," Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad. Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story. But I'll get to that later.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk," Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?",Lily
1,21, Milk, Nope. I hit the snooze button.,Ted
1,21, Milk, And here come the paramedics.,Robin
1,21, Milk," Oh, thank God, you're here.",Barney
1,21, Milk, I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.,Barney
1,21, Milk, What are you talking about?,Woman
1,21, Milk, You've had a terrible fall.,Barney
1,21, Milk," No, I haven't.",Woman
1,21, Milk, Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?,Barney
1,21, Milk, Give him your number.,All
1,21, Milk," Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.",Barney
1,21, Milk, Give him your number.,All
1,21, Milk, What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.,Barney
1,21, Milk, All right!,Woman
1,21, Milk, It works!,Barney
1,21, Milk, I cannot believe that she gave him her number.,Marshall
1,21, Milk, Maybe she really does have a brain injury.,Robin
1,21, Milk," Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.",Barney
1,21, Milk," I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Well, what's perfect?",Lily
1,21, Milk, It's not like I have a list.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Oh, yes, you do.",Robin
1,21, Milk," Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...",Ted
1,21, Milk, That's not hard. I know at least...,Lily
1,21, Milk," I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",Ted
1,21, Milk, Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.",Ted
1,21, Milk, You're never going to find this girl.,Lily
1,21, Milk, Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.,Ted
1,21, Milk," So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",Marshall
1,21, Milk, That's the plan.,Ted
1,21, Milk," And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk," Whoa, you're up early.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.",Lily
1,21, Milk, Does Marshall know?,Ted
1,21, Milk, He's still sound asleep.,Lily
1,21, Milk," Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
1,21, Milk," Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," God, why didn't you throw it away?",Ted
1,21, Milk, I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.,Lily
1,21, Milk, Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.,Marshall
1,21, Milk," What's wrong, baby?",Lily
1,21, Milk, This is the high point of my day.,Marshall
1,21, Milk," It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk," Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.",Marshall
1,21, Milk, Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,Barney
1,21, Milk," I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.",Barney
1,21, Milk, So?,Marshall
1,21, Milk," So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.",Barney
1,21, Milk, Oh! Sweet Lord.,Marshall
1,21, Milk, And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.,Barney
1,21, Milk, Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?,Marshall
1,21, Milk, Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.,Barney
1,21, Milk, You?,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.",Barney
1,21, Milk, What?,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",Barney
1,21, Milk, This is stupid.,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",Barney
1,21, Milk," This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",Barney
1,21, Milk," I get it. Thank you, Tracy.",Marshall
1,21, Milk, Hello?,Ted
1,21, Milk, Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?,Man
1,21, Milk, Speaking.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.",Man
1,21, Milk," Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate.",Bob
1,21, Milk, I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?,Ted
1,21, Milk," Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.",Bob
1,21, Milk, So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,Ted
1,21, Milk, There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.,Bob
1,21, Milk," No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.",Ted
1,21, Milk, She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file.,Bob
1,21, Milk," So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk," All right, fine. Set it up.",Ted
1,21, Milk," You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",Marshall
1,21, Milk, Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,Barney
1,21, Milk, Tastes normal to me.,Marshall
1,21, Milk," That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",Barney
1,21, Milk," Oh, God!",Marshall
1,21, Milk, It got me as well.,Barney
1,21, Milk," Well, then why did you have me drink it?!",Marshall
1,21, Milk, Because now... you're in.,Barney
1,21, Milk, Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",Barney
1,21, Milk," So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started...",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk, Lily?,Ted
1,21, Milk," Hey, Ted, are you busy?",Lily
1,21, Milk, Um... yes.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?",Lily
1,21, Milk, What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,Ted
1,21, Milk," Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",Lily
1,21, Milk," I can't, I'm waiting...",Ted
1,21, Milk," Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",Lily
1,21, Milk," Come on, Lily.",Ted
1,21, Milk, But you see my point.,Lily
1,21, Milk," All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",Ted
1,21, Milk," And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk," Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?",Lily
1,21, Milk, Yes.,Ted
1,21, Milk, And was she okay about pushing it back?,Lily
1,21, Milk, Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,Ted
1,21, Milk, You can never tell Marshall.,Lily
1,21, Milk, I won't.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,Lily
1,21, Milk, I swear on Luke and Leia.,Ted
1,21, Milk," About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",Lily
1,21, Milk, Did you talk to Marshall about it?,Ted
1,21, Milk," He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...",Lily
1,21, Milk, That was you? Awesome!,Ted
1,21, Milk," I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",Lily
1,21, Milk, Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,Ted
1,21, Milk," San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",Lily
1,21, Milk, You don't want to get married.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,Lily
1,21, Milk," Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",Lily
1,21, Milk, I don't think you're stupid.,Ted
1,21, Milk, I love Marshall.,Lily
1,21, Milk, I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,Ted
1,21, Milk, But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,Lily
1,21, Milk, So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,Marshall
1,21, Milk, All done.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Ted, let's go to New Haven.",Lily
1,21, Milk," Lily, don't do this to yourself.",Ted
1,21, Milk," I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",Lily
1,21, Milk," No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",Lily
1,21, Milk," I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.",Lily
1,21, Milk," Forgive you for what?  Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing.  Hey, I need a big favor.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Anything, bro.",Barney
1,21, Milk, I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.,Ted
1,21, Milk, No.,Barney
1,21, Milk, It's kind of an emergency.,Ted
1,21, Milk, What are you doing in Duchess County?,Barney
1,21, Milk, Apple picking. Can you just get up here?,Ted
1,21, Milk," I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.",Barney
1,21, Milk, Is that Ted?,Marshall
1,21, Milk, Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.,Barney
1,21, Milk, Don't you have a big date tonight?,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.",Ted
1,21, Milk, So what are you doing in Duchess County?,Marshall
1,21, Milk, Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!,Ted
1,21, Milk," Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.",Marshall
1,21, Milk, No!,Ted
1,21, Milk," Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.",Ted
1,21, Milk, So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?,Marshall
1,21, Milk, Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.",Barney
1,21, Milk," You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.",Marshall
1,21, Milk, You thinking about coming to work here full-time?,Barney
1,21, Milk," Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?",Marshall
1,21, Milk," Thanks, Tracy.",Barney
1,21, Milk, Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?,Barney
1,21, Milk, No.,Marshall
1,21, Milk, That would have been bad.,Barney
1,21, Milk, Horrible.,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk," Need a ride, cowboy?",Robin
1,21, Milk, Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Hmm, too bad. I got candy.",Robin
1,21, Milk, Candy?!,Ted
1,21, Milk, So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?,Robin
1,21, Milk, Nope. Sworn to secrecy.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Oh, come on.",Robin
1,21, Milk, I like your hat.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.,Robin
1,21, Milk," Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat.",Robin
1,21, Milk, Oh. I gotta see this.,Ted
1,21, Milk, No way.,Robin
1,21, Milk, Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!,Ted
1,21, Milk," So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?",Robin
1,21, Milk," Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.",Ted
1,21, Milk," Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.",Robin
1,21, Milk," Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.",Ted
1,21, Milk," I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.""",Robin
1,21, Milk," You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",Ted
1,21, Milk, We're not indoors. We're in a van.,Robin
1,21, Milk, Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Never. What else?,Robin
1,21, Milk, She loves lasagna.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Barf.,Robin
1,21, Milk," You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",Ted
1,21, Milk, What else?,Robin
1,21, Milk," Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",Ted
1,21, Milk, And she's looking to get married and have kids?,Robin
1,21, Milk, Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",Robin
1,21, Milk, Really? You don't want kids?,Ted
1,21, Milk," Hey, thanks for picking me up.",Ted
1,21, Milk, Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.,Robin
1,21, Milk, Thanks.,Ted
1,21, Milk," All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",Robin
1,21, Milk, You're going to show me your hair?,Ted
1,21, Milk," Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",Robin
1,21, Milk, You just made my night.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Go.,Robin
1,21, Milk," Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",Marshall
1,21, Milk," Hey, guys.",Ted
1,21, Milk, Hi.,Lily
1,21, Milk," Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",Ted
1,21, Milk," Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",Lily
1,21, Milk, You think you might want to... drink the milk?,Ted
1,21, Milk," No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",Lily
1,21, Milk," Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",Marshall
1,21, Milk, I didn't go.,Ted
1,21, Milk, What? Why?,Marshall
1,21, Milk, I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Why? She sounds perfect.,Marshall
1,21, Milk, I don't want perfect. I want Robin.,Ted
1,21, Milk," Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",Marshall
1,21, Milk, Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.,Ted
1,21, Milk, Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...,Marshall
1,21, Milk," Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,21, Milk," Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
1,21, Milk," Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
1,22, Come On, So... what do you think?,Ted
1,22, Come On," Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",Barney
1,22, Come On, But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?,Ted
1,22, Come On, Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?,Marshall
1,22, Come On," Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this.  Ow! What the hell?",Ted
1,22, Come On, That wasn't me. That was the universe.,Barney
1,22, Come On," The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,22, Come On," Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.",Sandy
1,22, Come On, Guess we'll have to take a rain check.,Robin
1,22, Come On," And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.",Sandy
1,22, Come On, Have a great night.,Robin
1,22, Come On," And, we're clear.",Man
1,22, Come On," Bummer. I was hoping to finally have s*x with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.",Sandy
1,22, Come On," Well, I'd give you the ""I don't date coworkers"" speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing.",Sandy
1,22, Come On," Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, ""enough""?",Marshall
1,22, Come On," One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",Ted
1,22, Come On," So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",Lily
1,22, Come On," I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",Ted
1,22, Come On," Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",Lily
1,22, Come On, Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",Marshall
1,22, Come On, She should be here any second.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",Ted
1,22, Come On, Damn it.,Robin
1,22, Come On, Hello.,Lily
1,22, Come On," Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",Robin
1,22, Come On, Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?,Lily
1,22, Come On," Yes, I gave it to you.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.",Lily
1,22, Come On," Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",Robin
1,22, Come On," No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",Lily
1,22, Come On," Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?",Lily
1,22, Come On, Summer fellowship?,Marshall
1,22, Come On, Just knock. Okay.,Robin
1,22, Come On, Hi.,Ted
1,22, Come On, Hi.,Robin
1,22, Come On," Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",Ted
1,22, Come On, Yes. No. I don't know.,Robin
1,22, Come On, Those are the three options.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Ted, this is so...",Robin
1,22, Come On, I know.,Ted
1,22, Come On," I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.",Ted
1,22, Come On," No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",Ted
1,22, Come On, Okay. Let's talk.,Robin
1,22, Come On," Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",Ted
1,22, Come On," Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks.  You're crazy.",Robin
1,22, Come On, Right. Come on.,Ted
1,22, Come On," It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",Robin
1,22, Come On, I know. But... come on...,Ted
1,22, Come On," And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",Ted
1,22, Come On," I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",Robin
1,22, Come On, I thought that thing was canceled.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Well, it's back on.",Robin
1,22, Come On, Since when?,Ted
1,22, Come On, Since like an hour ago.,Robin
1,22, Come On," Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York.",Sandy
1,22, Come On, And we're clear.,Man
1,22, Come On, You're leaving?,Robin
1,22, Come On, There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.,Sandy
1,22, Come On," Oh, congratulations.",Robin
1,22, Come On, Congratulations yourself.,Sandy
1,22, Come On, What do you mean?,Robin
1,22, Come On," Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.",Sandy
1,22, Come On," Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Yes, what?",Sandy
1,22, Come On," Yes, let's go get dinner.",Robin
1,22, Come On, How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie.,Sandy
1,22, Come On," Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.",Ted
1,22, Come On," Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",Robin
1,22, Come On, Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?,Ted
1,22, Come On, I don't-I don't know.,Robin
1,22, Come On," So, what? You actually like this guy now?",Ted
1,22, Come On, I don't know.,Robin
1,22, Come On, Are you gonna hook up with him?,Ted
1,22, Come On, I don't know.,Robin
1,22, Come On," Yes, you do.",Ted
1,22, Come On," No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.",Robin
1,22, Come On, I don't plan out every...,Ted
1,22, Come On," Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, ""Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",Robin
1,22, Come On," Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",Ted
1,22, Come On, I need to think about this.,Robin
1,22, Come On, Fine.,Ted
1,22, Come On," No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.",Robin
1,22, Come On," If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",Ted
1,22, Come On," Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",Robin
1,22, Come On, Then I guess it's not meant to be.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Nice try, buddy.",Barney
1,22, Come On, Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.,Marshall
1,22, Come On, Screw that. This ain't over.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",Marshall
1,22, Come On," I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",Ted
1,22, Come On, Unpause?,Lily
1,22, Come On, Unpause.,Marshall
1,22, Come On," Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days.",Future Ted(Narrator)
1,22, Come On, A painting fellowship?,Marshall
1,22, Come On, I was never going to take it.,Lily
1,22, Come On, In California?,Marshall
1,22, Come On, I was never going to take it.,Lily
1,22, Come On," Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.",Barney
1,22, Come On," Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.",Ted
1,22, Come On, What are you talking about?,Barney
1,22, Come On, I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!,Ted
1,22, Come On," Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.",Barney
1,22, Come On," Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",Ted
1,22, Come On, Yeah.,Barney
1,22, Come On, Are you still in touch with her?,Ted
1,22, Come On," Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!",Barney
1,22, Come On," Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.",Ted
1,22, Come On," Did you just say a ""rain dance""?",Barney
1,22, Come On, Yes.,Ted
1,22, Come On, A rain dance.,Barney
1,22, Come On, Yes.,Ted
1,22, Come On, A dance to make it rain.,Barney
1,22, Come On, Yes.  We're finding Penelope!,Ted
1,22, Come On," No, we are not!",Barney
1,22, Come On," Yes, we are!",Ted
1,22, Come On," Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!",Barney
1,22, Come On," Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.",Barney
1,22, Come On, Twice!,Barney
1,22, Come On, Shh!,Barney
1,22, Come On," Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.",Ted
1,22, Come On, There's this girl...,Ted
1,22, Come On," Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.",Ted
1,22, Come On, Absolutely.,Ted
1,22, Come On, Kind of.,Ted
1,22, Come On, Hey.,Barney
1,22, Come On, We weren't exclusive!,Barney
1,22, Come On, And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.,Future Ted(Narrator)
1,22, Come On," Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.",Barney
1,22, Come On, There's so much of your mom in you.,Barney
1,22, Come On, And she's been throwing up ever since.,Robin
1,22, Come On," Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...",Robin
1,22, Come On," Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?",Robin
1,22, Come On, Exactly.,Robin
1,22, Come On, So you're saying you would forbid me from going?,Lily
1,22, Come On," Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.",Marshall
1,22, Come On," Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.",Lily
1,22, Come On," So now we've gone from ""I was never gonna do it"" to ""I need to do this""? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?",Marshall
1,22, Come On," Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.",Lily
1,22, Come On," I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.",Marshall
1,22, Come On, Maybe not.,Lily
1,22, Come On, Pause.,Marshall
1,22, Come On," So, are you just, like, starving?",Lily
1,22, Come On, Totally. Red Lobster?,Marshall
1,22, Come On," Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!",Lily
1,22, Come On," Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.",Marshall
1,22, Come On," I wouldn't dare.  Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!",Lily
1,22, Come On," Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.",Barney
1,22, Come On," Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?",Ted
1,22, Come On," Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?",Ted
1,22, Come On," Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?",Ted
1,22, Come On, No?,Ted
1,22, Come On, Have you ever seen a rain dance?,Ted
1,22, Come On," Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.",Ted
1,22, Come On," How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.",Marshall
1,22, Come On, I think there's still one left.,Lily
1,22, Come On, Dibs.,Marshall
1,22, Come On, Unpause?,Lily
1,22, Come On, Unpause.,Marshall
1,22, Come On, Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.,Lily
1,22, Come On," I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.",Marshall
1,22, Come On, Why not?,Lily
1,22, Come On," Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",Marshall
1,22, Come On, Marshall...,Lily
1,22, Come On," 'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.",Marshall
1,22, Come On," Marshall, I love you.",Lily
1,22, Come On, Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?,Marshall
1,22, Come On, Pause.,Lily
1,22, Come On," No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!",Marshall
1,22, Come On, Pause!,Lily
1,22, Come On," Why do you want me to pause?!  That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.",Marshall
1,22, Come On, Thank you.,Lily
1,22, Come On," Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?",Barney
1,22, Come On, A rain dance.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.",Barney
1,22, Come On," Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.",Ted
1,22, Come On, These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!,Barney
1,22, Come On, Yeah. I know that.,Ted
1,22, Come On," Well, then why are you doing this?",Barney
1,22, Come On," Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!",Ted
1,22, Come On," Oh, come on!",Barney
1,22, Come On, How about that? He did it.,Barney
1,22, Come On," Robin! Hey, Robin!  Oh, thank God you're here!",Ted
1,22, Come On, My camping trip got rained out.,Robin
1,22, Come On, I know. I'm sorry.,Ted
1,22, Come On, It's not your fault.,Robin
1,22, Come On," Yeah, it is. Come down here.",Ted
1,22, Come On, It's pouring. You come up.,Robin
1,22, Come On," No, you have to come down here.",Ted
1,22, Come On, Why?,Robin
1,22, Come On," Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",Ted
1,22, Come On," I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.",Robin
1,22, Come On," I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!",Ted
1,22, Come On, I was gonna...,Robin
1,22, Come On, I know.,Ted
1,22, Come On," And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same. It all looked the same. But it wasn't. In just one night, everything had changed.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,1, Where Were We?," OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great.  In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his .",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, So that's it? We're breaking up?,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.",Lily
2,1, Where Were We?," For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, I should call her.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, You're a good friend Ted.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Hey! So, did you hear the big news?",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, Thanks.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, Sure.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting ""What's up New York?"" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... . Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning  and love is ending  the first thirty days are remarkably similar.  For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed  Your friends can't stand to listen to you . And you never seems to wear pants. .",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,1, Where Were We?, Hey Marshall.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Hey Ted.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, Are you hungry?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Beer.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," No, that's what you had for dinner.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, You should write and illustrate children's books.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, What?,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," God, your eyes are so blue.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Teddy bear... ,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. .",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,1, Where Were We?," So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, That's my shampoo.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Oh. Sorry.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, I thought he's never go to sleep.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Uh-oh.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Already?,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, He's calling her. Dammit!,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, He slept on our floor last night Ted.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, He watched a scary movie.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Mmm. Sunshine.,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!",Man
2,1, Where Were We?," Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, There are a lot of them.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.",Man
2,1, Where Were We?," Oh, no. ",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart!  You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? ",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," Yeah, that's the stuff.",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... guns are fun!",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... ",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, I should have mention the recoil.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. ",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Oh! What do I win?,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, You are? That's so nice!,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, So?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," I know, but I just...",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around.",Lily
2,1, Where Were We?," Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style.",Lily
2,1, Where Were We?," Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.",Lily
2,1, Where Were We?," Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.",Lily
2,1, Where Were We?," It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.",Lily
2,1, Where Were We?, That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, Those charges are from a month ago.,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, Exactly!,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... .",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, Why do you talk? Why do you talk?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York.  I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," OK, you know what? I'm calling her.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing.  You, come here. . While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this.  Come here my little baby. ,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, Marshall!,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Marshall! Marshall!,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to!",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, Everything we've worked so hard for...!,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, Hang up now!,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Ted, I can't hang up now.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Hello?!  A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, No!,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," Dude, you can't...",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," Marshall, you can't do that!",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Really? Why not?,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, 56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,1, Where Were We?," Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Bold. Bold to go for the car.,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, What?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, I didn't say a thing.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, You think I was too hard on him.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, I didn't say a thing.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut?",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," No, I'm a gun enthusiast.",Robin
2,1, Where Were We?, Do you know how many people are killed...,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, A little.,Robin
2,1, Where Were We?," I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Barney.,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?," Uh, hey. Where are you guys?",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.,Barney

2,1, Where Were We?, What? What uh-oh?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, He's gone.,Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!",Barney
2,1, Where Were We?, Barney![End of the phone call],Ted

2,1, Where Were We?, What happened?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," Well, I went up to Lily's floor...",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?,"...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. .",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, What? Who was he?,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer...",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,1, Where Were We?," Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?",Lily
2,1, Where Were We?," So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Ted.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, Yeah.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.,Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?," What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.",Ted
2,1, Where Were We?," OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.",Marshall
2,1, Where Were We?, Cheers.,Ted
2,1, Where Were We?, Ted. Ted you should see this.,Robin

3,7, Dowisetrepla, So is that a yes? You can't sleep with other women though.,Lily
3,7, Dowisetrepla," No we're not getting divorced, not even on paper. Lily, when i married you, i married your problems too. The ones i knew about and the ones i didn't. So that was the deal, we'll figure this out together. ",Marshall

3,7, Dowisetrepla, So what's the annoucement?,Robin

2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Why would you call me that?,Lily

2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.,Marshall
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.,Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, There's only one of her?,Marshall
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?,Ted

2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.",Ted

2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?,Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, No!,Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Why not?,Lily

2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Are you sick?,Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?,Barney
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," No, I meant do you have a cold?",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.",Barney

2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?",Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.,Marshall
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Wow, that's a great gift.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.,Marshall
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.",Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.,Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Dude... how was the concert?,Ted

2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.,Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?",Marshall
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Staten Island.,Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Why?,Marshall
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," No, dude, real presents.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.",Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.,Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Are you coming home?,Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?",Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Yes,Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?,Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas," Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.",Ted
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.,Lily
2,11, How Lily Stole Christmas, Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Super. So I'll call you.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I hope so.,Woman
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Look at this.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Yeah, it's true.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him.""",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Jesus.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, The dialogues seem pompous old now.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," But I said nothing about texting. I started with something pretty and charming. ""I thought about you, then, I thought you send a text message piti."" By pressing send, I realized that it was not at all charming. That was the thing that sucks the most anyone has told someone. And the worst with texting, is that once sent... can not recover them. And then... you wait. And just when you decided to never again send a text message...  ""I thought you too, it's crazy that you send me a text when I'm in my bath.""",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What was that?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What?,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You made a noise.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," This is my laptop, a text message.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What?,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," When you see a naked girl, you make noise.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, That's not true.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Really?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Sorry, Lily.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It's a breast.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," To call. Texting, it's different.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I make no noise.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Really?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Holly and I, we had sent text messages until 2am.And all the next day, too. It seemed perfect.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, How do you know?,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Because no woman in history has never, ""asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. """,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. ""Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Come down.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.""Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Hi guys! What is it?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, A meal that I Generro back to Lily.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What?,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""Piti texting""?",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It's better.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I wear them right now and they are very sexy.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, He put the boots!,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Or... we remove our shirts.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It's better.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I believe that wearing anything underneath.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It is hot.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I think we'll... have s*x with Ted.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You did this all day? This is wicked.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything.""",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, The same he had with you the first time.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, We all know what it gave.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I'm in love with you.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? """,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. """,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. """,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, And he really knows not what means MDR.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, And then we met Stan.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Super Stan. Who is it?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, A guard who works nights.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, He eats here every day.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, And he had not finished.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Far from it.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It's... really nice.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, No matter. It's OK.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It is perhaps not in love with us.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, How is this possible? It's all there waiting!,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I do not understand men.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Do... you come back?,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Yes.  Or...,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Really? How she explained the scope of texting?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You cling to Barney and Marshall.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What?,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, It's true.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Yes, it was them.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Incredible!,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I love this thing someone said about three months to live.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. """,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live.",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Wait. I think I have.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," He replied! ""I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. """,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," That's it, man. This is the ""I love you.""",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I would like Stan to be there.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Stan. What?,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.""",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. """,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Dude, I'm his best friend.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he époustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, I know. It's weird.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And by ""me"", he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams.",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?",Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You can tell us. This is a secure area.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Your feelings are quite natural.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, That's what happened.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And I wasted half an hour of life of these bastards, tell them about this dream where I dine with my top 5 best architects.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, ""Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.""Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up.",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, That's it?,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel?",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Of course.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," So, the machines... killed everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?",Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you?",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Holly and I are going to dinner.,Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Sorry. It was just trying to help you.,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," And also, it was really funny.",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule," I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an ""I"".",Ted
4,21, The Three Days Rule," I had proved that the Rule of Three Days was wrong and I went out to dinner with a pretty girl. And so far, I have told anyone the truth about this hot date.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Finally, I did not have to wait three days, but Holly should really have. Like many rules, sometimes you follow them and sometimes not. But I will say this. When I was your mother's number, I called immediately.",Future Ted(Narrator)
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You work right?,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Great! We can have fun!,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Yes.,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule, What...,Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?,Marshall
4,21, The Three Days Rule," Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?",Barney
4,21, The Three Days Rule, You know their names?,Robin
4,21, The Three Days Rule," No, it's Marshall. Married to Lily.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?",Barney

2,10, Single Stamina," Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,10, Single Stamina," Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.",Barney

2,10, Single Stamina," Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," What up, New York.",James
2,10, Single Stamina, Thanks for the heads up.,Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," Yeah, so now the wedding's back on.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Anyway, James, how have you been?",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Awesome, as per ""yoozh."" I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.""Legendarier."" And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it.

C'mon. Gimme five.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Is ""gimme five"" back?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Guys, ""gimme five"" is back!",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina, - Hey. It's so nice to meet you.,Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," - You, too.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," So, I have to ask, there's a story here.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,10, Single Stamina, - Coffee?,James
2,10, Single Stamina, So what are you guys gonna do tonight?,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Okay.,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina, It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina,  He was a little bit way into black guys.,James
2,10, Single Stamina, Whoa. Your scarf... it is fierce!,James
2,10, Single Stamina," What? I would never know, 'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see. Hey! You know, speaking of things that would look good wrapped around you, have you met my straight brother, Barney? Oh, he is fab--don't you go nowhere-- ""ulous."" Okay?",James
2,10, Single Stamina, And Barney always returned the favor.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,10, Single Stamina," Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, my God, I do!",Man
2,10, Single Stamina,"  Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?",James
2,10, Single Stamina, - No.,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina, - Jammies.,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys... you are young, attractive people here in the greatest city on earth. There are boys and girls in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here. But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement. You owe it to them to rise up and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot, and you go out there and you live their dream!- Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Can I get a ""woo-woo""?",James
2,10, Single Stamina, Go do it for Wyoming!,James
2,10, Single Stamina, Testify!,James
2,10, Single Stamina," So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,10, Single Stamina," Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man.",James
2,10, Single Stamina, I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?",James
2,10, Single Stamina, - Let's ride.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," - Fo' 'sho. Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!",James
2,10, Single Stamina," - Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, - What? What?,James
2,10, Single Stamina, - What? What?,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Cool.,James
2,10, Single Stamina, Let me know if he bothers you again.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,10, Single Stamina, - Break.,James
2,10, Single Stamina, - Boiling hot.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,10, Single Stamina," - Hey! - Hi, how are ya?",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, hello. Have a drink.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Nice to meet ya.,James
2,10, Single Stamina," Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,10, Single Stamina," I wish I would've worn sneakers. I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy who was periscoping out of his pleather pants. Permission to come aboard denied.",James
2,10, Single Stamina, I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this.,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina, Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.,Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo.",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe?",Man
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, please go sweat on someone else.",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina, Poor guy.,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, Poor guy? Poor my boobs.,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside.",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," ""Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have s*x with me."" Waa.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," ""Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but can't order because they'll be made fun of.""",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, - Dude.,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina, - They're delicious!,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, Excuse me. Join me in a shot?,Man
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, no thanks. I've had enough. He's too in shape, we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it... because I can.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight.",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina, No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.,Robin
2,10, Single Stamina, Look at that. He's texting!,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, my God! He is in a couple.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina, This is gonna kill Barney.,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina, What's gonna kill me? What's going on?,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex...",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Hey, bro.",James
2,10, Single Stamina, Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Why?,James
2,10, Single Stamina, I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?",James
2,10, Single Stamina, That is Tom. And he's my fiancé.,James
2,10, Single Stamina, Hey.,James
2,10, Single Stamina, I don't support this.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Gay marriage?,James
2,10, Single Stamina," Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man.",James
2,10, Single Stamina, What? No way.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Two beers, one shot.",Woman
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina, Yes.,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, I don't get manicures.,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, You get your chest waxed?,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?,James
2,10, Single Stamina," What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, Hey. You work out?,Man
2,10, Single Stamina, I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Well, I try. So you want to dance?",Man
2,10, Single Stamina," You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...",Man
2,10, Single Stamina," No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," No, it isn't.",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina, Whatever. How 'bout you?,Man
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Hey, I really like your sweater.",Man
2,10, Single Stamina," Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?",Man
2,10, Single Stamina, I love this place! Let's dance!,Robin
2,10, Single Stamina,  - And not be groped!,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina, - Whoo! Thank you.,Robin
2,10, Single Stamina, - Thank you!,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina, - We're hot.,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, - Totally.,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina,"  And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!",James
2,10, Single Stamina, Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Please.,James
2,10, Single Stamina," He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.,Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!",Man
2,10, Single Stamina," Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?",Man
2,10, Single Stamina," God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina, And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!,Ted
2,10, Single Stamina, Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Barney.,James
2,10, Single Stamina," So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married.",James
2,10, Single Stamina, - Thank you.,James
2,10, Single Stamina," Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...",James
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, To get laid.,James
2,10, Single Stamina," To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina," - Yes, I do.",James
2,10, Single Stamina, - Why?!,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.,James
2,10, Single Stamina, What? There's gonna be a baby?,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Yes. We're adopting.,James
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, For the rest of your life.,James
2,10, Single Stamina, To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.,Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.",Ted
2,10, Single Stamina," Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.",Robin
2,10, Single Stamina," All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.",Marshall
2,10, Single Stamina," Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.",Lily
2,10, Single Stamina," Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.",Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, - May I?,Barney
2,10, Single Stamina, - Yeah.,James
2,10, Single Stamina," Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet,...learn about relationships is that you're never done getting to know someone.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,9, Slap Bet, You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Some aren't as nice.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,9, Slap Bet," And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, I got your total...counting along...",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, And some are just weird.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,9, Slap Bet, You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Why?,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Come on, let's go.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," All right, I'm in.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, To the Willowbrook Mall!,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, What? Why not?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I just don't feel like going to a mall.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, We can split a cinnabun.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," No, I'm really not gonna go.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Come on, it'll be fun.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Why not?,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, I'd rather not say.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Thanks Ted.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," So, what's the deal with you and malls?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, No.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Dumped in a mall?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Ted.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Found out you were Canadian at a mall?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Let it go.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Mauled at the mall?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, The 'oh' moment?,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Oh.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Oh.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Oh.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I love you.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I used to be a dude.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, It's true. They tell each other everything.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Try me.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," OK, Seattle.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Damn.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, What happened next?,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, You know?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p0rn, wait for it, ography.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Hey.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, What? The walls are thin.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, Married? What does have to do with the mall?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, We're not getting married at the mall.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Just meet with the guy.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, She's not married. Robin hates marriage.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Because she already got married, at the mall.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, She's a pretty private person.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, Except when she's talking about...,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, What do you think of this wedding cake?,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, No.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Thank you Barney.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, 'Cause it's p0rn.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, I need another beer.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Robin is not in p0rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," 20,000 says it's p0rn.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," I don't have 20,000.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Well then, what do you have?",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Well.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, No.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, What the hell's a slap bet?,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, I love it. What are my powers?",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," And your tombstone will read, ""got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.""",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, you're right.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Husband.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, There's no 'p' in husband.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Fine, I'll take it back.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Huh.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Ted, I don't understand why you can't...",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Oh.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Why didn't you get divorced?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, OK.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Your hand is monstrous.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, No I didn't.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Fine, Robin's married.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Ha ha ha.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, It's serious to me.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, I can see my hand print on your face.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p0rn from Canada I have to go through.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p0rn.",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Canadian p0rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Hey.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Robin's not married.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," What? Then, why would she tell me she was?",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, There must be some mistake.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Thanks Ted.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I say we just move on.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Ah, Canada in June. That's great.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Sit down or buffet.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Um...,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Hm. Band of DJ?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Color scheme?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Dusty rose and sienna.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Husband's name?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Um.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, You were never married.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, Yes I was.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, No you weren't.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, How do you know?,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, I looked it up at the library.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, What library?,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, The one on 5th.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, When did you go?,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, You told Marshall?,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, You lied to me!,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, But it was a fake secret.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Testing me, that's insane.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, That wasn't a real secret.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, but it could have been.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, He moved there for business.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," You, you got something to say to me?",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, How could you possibly know that?,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Barney gets three slaps.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Three?,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, So I just got a very interesting phone call.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, What are you talking about?,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I know Robin's secret.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, What?,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Yeah. No I don't.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, What?,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," Barney, don't, okay.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet," No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Are you as terrified as I am?,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, I don't wanna get slapped again.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, I wanna stress that I was young.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Yeah you were.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, And I didn't know any better.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, They never do.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, It always does.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Oh my God.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, What the hell was that?,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, I was a teenage pop star in Canada.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, That's you?,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p0rn.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.,Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet, Go with the 10 now.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet," Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet, I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,Barney
2,9, Slap Bet, Good call.,Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, Horrible call.,Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.",Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",Lily
2,9, Slap Bet," Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.",Ted
2,9, Slap Bet," You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.",Robin
2,9, Slap Bet, That's one.,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet, The robot! Hey!,Marshall
2,9, Slap Bet," No, she doesn't wanna wait.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, I think I'm in love with you.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, What?!,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,12, First Time in New York, Spider! Spider!,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, I left something in the hallway.,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, Where?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Right there.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Got it.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, First there's the moment when you think you think it.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,12, First Time in New York," Whoa, still alive.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, There's the moment you think you know it.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Totally worth it.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,12, First Time in New York," All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Good night.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Good night.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Wait, Ted?",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Yeah?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Good night.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie.  Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Really? You'd do that?,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,12, First Time in New York, Ted.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Yeah?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Falafel.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Falafel?,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, Falafel.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, I totally choked.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, What?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, here comes Katie.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Aw, your sister's so cute.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Hello, Kitty.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, no. No. No. No.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, That's cool. This is my friend Lily.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Uh, no, you're not.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, What? Oh. Oh...,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, I don't have any of those.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, That's why I need your help.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,12, First Time in New York, You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Totally. You should wait.,All
2,12, First Time in New York, s*x is fun.,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, See?,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Even Kyle gets to do that.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," You smoke now, too?",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, remember cloves?",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, No!,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, We were 18.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, Barney was probably 12.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, 17.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Dude, me, too.",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," Barney, you okay?",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, What camp?,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, What did you teach?,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Uh, dance.",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, Dance?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, Sylvia,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, How you call your loverboy?,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, And if he doesn't answer,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, And if he still doesn't answer?,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, That's Dirty Dancing.,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, It was on last night.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, Do you remember our first time?,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, Yeah. It was back in college.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, New Year's Eve.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, Okay.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, That's not a good idea.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, Why not?,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, that's adorable.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, tell her what happened next.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, That was amazing.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, Yeah. Want to do it again?,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, We said we were sorry.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, mine was terrible.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Wait, I've never heard your story.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Yeah.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, I know.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, Brian.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, I'm so sorry.,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Eh, I should've known. There were signs.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," What?! Oh, my God!",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, What do you mean just barely?,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York,  Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Yes, it does.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," No, it doesn't.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Yes, it does.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, Who's Scooter?,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," No, Marshall, they say,  ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, It's not stupid.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," I, um...",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Just let me explain.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," What, you mean like I did?",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Weird... or courageous?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, You... What?,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," I take my ""I love you"" back.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, You can't take it back.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. ",Man
2,12, First Time in New York," Marshall, why is this such a big deal?",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Okay, Marshall, I get it.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!,Man

2,12, First Time in New York, That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Hey.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Hey.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, She didn't do it.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Hey, that's great! You got through to her.",Ted

2,12, First Time in New York," Hey, Katie.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, I love you, too, Molly.  But I didn't.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Look, I got to go.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.  But I didn't. Molly?",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back. But I didn't.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Don't tell Mom.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Thanks for doing that.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, well...",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," I love you, Molly.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Wow. That was amazing.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Wh-Where are you going?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Will you call me?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Yeah?,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, But she didn't.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.",Robin
2,12, First Time in New York," I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.,Robin
2,12, First Time in New York, Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.,Future Ted(Narrator)
2,12, First Time in New York, I am so glad we're finally doing this.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, We've only had s*x with each other.,Lily
2,12, First Time in New York, They've only had s*x with each other.,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," Well, we're usually busy... drinking.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.",Lily
2,12, First Time in New York," That's right, I almost forgot.",Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, Fast Times at Ridgemont High.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York," I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, Risky Business.,Ted
2,12, First Time in New York, I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...,Barney
2,12, First Time in New York," That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.",Ted
2,12, First Time in New York," All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?",Barney
2,12, First Time in New York, Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.,Marshall
2,12, First Time in New York, Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," ""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, What's tomorrow night?,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, my God.",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, my gosh.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Stay strong. We're so sorry. ,All
2,14, Monday Night Football, Who was Mark?,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, No idea.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Not a clue.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Well, I guess we should go, right?",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, Mark.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football, Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.,All
2,14, Monday Night Football, Mark.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Mark, and start watching only an hour late.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Amen.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Amen.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Yeah, they're the best part.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Have I taught you nothing, Ted?",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Virtually.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Sartorial""?",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," ""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Such a waste.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, I know. He was so young.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.",Carl
2,14, Monday Night Football, Dibs on the one Carl just told.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score.",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, thank God! I'll find out.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Second down, everyone drink.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Calm down, buddy.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, commercials!",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football, Everyone drink!,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Fine.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," See, there you go, he made it. You win.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Nothing, it's the halftime show.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," God, how cool is Robin?",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, That's impossible.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, I'm in.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football, I'm in.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, I'm in.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," What the hell, I'm in. High five!",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Dude, we're at a wake.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, Sorry. Solemn low five.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,14, Monday Night Football," Hey, take this key and swallow it.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, What? No.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Lots more, no.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,14, Monday Night Football," But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," You're right, Kevin.",Man
2,14, Monday Night Football, No!,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, No.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," No, it's not. It's time for Weather.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,14, Monday Night Football, And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster.""",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football, Hey. I'm Doug.,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football,  I know who won.,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, How badly do you not want to know?,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football, Excuse me?,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Ten bucks.,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football, Are you serious?,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Just went up to eight.,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Not until game time.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, Where are you going?,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Pick up the hot wings.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, And we're clear.,Man
2,14, Monday Night Football, I'm sorry.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?",Woman
2,14, Monday Night Football," I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, That is crazy. I can't do that.,Woman
2,14, Monday Night Football, My friend Mark passed away this week.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.",Woman
2,14, Monday Night Football, Back in five... four... three...,Man
2,14, Monday Night Football, It's just so hard.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked!  I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?!  No...!,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,14, Monday Night Football, Where's the dipping sauce?,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?",Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Okay, now who did this?",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football, I did.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.",Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football, Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.",Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, Hey. Hey.,Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football, I'm not talking to you.,Marshall

2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," No, I didn't.",Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football," Okay, okay. You win.",Doug
2,14, Monday Night Football, I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football," Sir, who won the Super Bowl?",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Sorry. I missed the game.,Man
2,14, Monday Night Football, You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, No...!,Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football, Hello! It's me again.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, No...!,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, Yes...!,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, Mission accomplished.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football, Didn't find out.,Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready.  Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football, Way to blow it.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.",Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, There's no point in even watching the game.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football, Wings are still good.,Marshall
2,14, Monday Night Football, Beer still works.,Robin
2,14, Monday Night Football," Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money.",Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football, I almost got fired today.,Robin

2,14, Monday Night Football, I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.,Ted
2,14, Monday Night Football," Yeah, go ahead, Barney.",Lily
2,14, Monday Night Football," Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?",Future Ted(Narrator)
2,14, Monday Night Football," I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?",Barney
2,14, Monday Night Football," 50-50, give or take.",Ted

3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Guys, guys, guys! Can I tell my news? It's pretty...",Marshall
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil war.,Ted

3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Um, interesting. There I am in the office of Jefferson Coatsworth and I figure I'm not gonna take this job anyway, I might as well give this old b*st*rd a piece of mind. Jefferson Coastworth wasn't what I expected.",Marshall
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, Hello.,Marshall
3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Marshall was thrown. This guy seemed nice. Of course, he wasn't.",Future Ted(Narrator)

3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique.",Barney
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, What do you mean?,Marshall
3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting ""oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y""! And by you, I mean her.",Barney
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.,Marshall
3,6, I'm Not That Guy," That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?",Barney

3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.",Lily
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, Don't wait up.,Barney
3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Ted Mosby p0rn star's bio says his hometown is your hometown. Shaker Heights, Ohio.",Robin

3,6, I'm Not That Guy, Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America.,Barney
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, You can really taste the beef in that lobster.,Marshall

3,6, I'm Not That Guy, Cause Robin was about to ask Lily the one question...,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,6, I'm Not That Guy," And you make a kindergarten teacher's salary, right?",Robin
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, Yeah.,Lily
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, That Lily had been dreading for years.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,6, I'm Not That Guy," Well, how do you afford all of these expensive clothes?",Robin
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, I shop the sales. There were in the closet when we moved in. I steal. I'm a criminal. I once shot a man just to watch him die.,Lily
3,6, I'm Not That Guy, Lily?,Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her...",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Everyone, this is Blah-blah.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Please call me Blah.,Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," So, Blah, how did you two meet?",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, It was so magical.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Except it wasn't.,Future Ted(Narrator)
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Ay, Chihuahua.",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, What? There's no stigma anymore.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," So, she's hot.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh, she's gorgeous.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Then she's crazy.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, No she's not.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Wait, hot-crazy scale?",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Let me illustrate.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, A girl is allowed to be crazy...,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,... as long as she is equally hot.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, You want the girl to be above this line,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,...then lose ten pounds.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, She'd stab me with a fork...,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,... then get a boob job.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I should give her a call.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, She's not crazy.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," OK, we'll see.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Aw.,Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Starts with it too.,Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," When you've been a couple as long as Marshall and Lily, telling the how we met story becomes a choreographed dance.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, It was late August 1996,Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Lily and I were both freshmen moving into,Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Ohhh.,Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I know, right?",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings. The first time Marshall told it to me, it was a little different.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today,  wanna tap that.",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Saw 'aw.',Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Really? Sixteen no's. Really?,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," So, you're single.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Yeah.,Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Kids, to understand this story, you need to know that your Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich.",Future Ted(Narrator)
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.,Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, You're not the dean.,Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," College, good times.",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh, here we go.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Wow, that just came out of nowhere.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?,Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh, I'm sorry about that.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh man, I'm really sorry.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Wow, you bought that?",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Ted.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Are you a total idiot, Ted?",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I like you Ted.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Barney. We met at the urinal.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh right, hi.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I'm not wearing a suit.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,"  Edward, this is Audrey.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,  I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,  My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,  He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh my God, you told them.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Wait, you guys dated. For how long?",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",Robin
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, She started the night here,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Their story is not as magical as it seems.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, What do you mean?,Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Oh my God.,Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, You have to tell Marshall.,Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," If he heard that, it would destroy him.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," If you don't tell him, I will.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Oh, come on, you wouldn't.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Oh no.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Tell us what?,Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Lily, will you help us get the next round?",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Ted, what's going on?",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," She knows about us, about how we really met.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yeah, I know, I just told her.",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, the real story.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Ted, what are you talking about?",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Lily, come on.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Come on what?,Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Lily, come on.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Lily, come on.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.,Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, What? Ted and I never made out.,Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yeah, we did.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, That wasn't me.,Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, no no no no no no no no no no no.",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, It was right over there.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I'm sorry, who are you again?",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?",Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.,Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.",Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, That man is a god.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.,Barney
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private?",Lily
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Yeah, of course, what's wrong?",Marshall

3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.",Marshall
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else,"  You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily.",Blah-blah
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,Ted
3,5, How I Met Everyone Else," Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year.

3,5, How I Met Everyone Else, World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?,Barney

4,1, Do I Know You?," Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny.",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" Classic.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?",Barney

4,1, Do I Know You?, Really?,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, ""How can an ant carry ""20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?"" Are the two even related? Really?",Barney

4,1, Do I Know You?," Well, what do you want, then?",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?, I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that.",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little b*st*rd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?",Lily

4,1, Do I Know You?, Sweet.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?, It's no worse than your super-obvious code words.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Rhinoceros.,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?, We have to go.,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, Great. Now we need a new code word.,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure?",Barney

4,1, Do I Know You?," Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.",Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, Just ask her out.,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Gross.,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?, First movie you ever saw.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," Benji,1981. I watched it recently with Lucy and I just thought, ""Oh, that dog is so dead right now."" What about you?",Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?, My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," You know, I've actually never seen Star Wars.",Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, You've got to calm down.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," Dude, it's just a movie.",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, It's just a movie. It's just a movie!,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, You can't.,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, You want to watch it again?,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, I do.,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?, Why?,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Ted hit that for over a year.,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?, Wish me luck.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," The movie's already started, so...",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway.,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," Oh, my God. Marshall appears behind the couch.",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, Off to a bad start.,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, What are you doing down there?,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing.,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job.",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," I really do, don't I?",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, What?,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?," I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Why are you acting like this?,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, Like what?,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.",Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?," I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.",Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, Your teeth look fantastic.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Who are you?,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, What?,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?, Nothing.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, You were staring at me.,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?, You look really beautiful tonight.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck",Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?",Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?, Nothing.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go.",Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," Should I leave, too?",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," What part, what part?",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, Thanks.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?," I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.",Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, Why not?,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, It's not as easy...,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, Promise me you'll apply.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, I promise.,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?," She's up to the scene where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's trash compactor.",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, Great scene.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?," Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep.",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, I'll tell her you still want to be friends.,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly... ""Stop watching me, jackasses.""",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, To taking chances.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, To taking chances.,Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?," You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, Of course it is. One more for the road?,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?",Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, I loved it.,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?, Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.,Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, What was that?,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you m*st*rb*t*ng little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room.",Ted
4,1, Do I Know You?, It was so good.,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," You hated it, didn't you?",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?",Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?, Wookiee.,Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, ""That's a good point, Bear, ""let's try that.""",Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?, I do.,Stella
4,1, Do I Know You?," Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.",Marshall
4,1, Do I Know You?," So, here's the deal.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.",Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?, Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.",Robin
4,1, Do I Know You?," Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, And that was it.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now.",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?, I choose bimbos.,Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?, What?,Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.",Barney
4,1, Do I Know You?," This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.",Lily
4,1, Do I Know You?," Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?",Barney

4,23, As Fast as She Can," No, between. It's not weird at all.",Ted
4,23, As Fast as She Can," I knew it was wrong to steal someone's girlfriend. I got used to it. I could not sleep. And for the wrong reasons.Sometimes for good reasons. Stella and I, we had not seen for five years, so you can imagine, at first it was fast and intense.Broken lamps, furniture moved. You see this bald area?Regardless, we turned the page. Me, Lucy, Stella, we would be moving to LA I was going to become a screenwriter. Then, you have been crossed, and you looked so... sad.",Tony
4,23, As Fast as She Can, Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance.,Ted
4,23, As Fast as She Can," You're wrong, OK? As a small dachshund with back pain who should be walking in a bag.",Tony
4,23, As Fast as She Can, Why are you here?,Ted

If I had not done that, I would have missed the cut by the booth and came 77th in this corner a minute earlier. I would have had the bagel, worked a little, and you children, you would not be born.

6,4, Subway Wars," Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.",Marshall
6,4, Subway Wars, Why did I get so crazy about this?,Lily
6,4, Subway Wars," Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.",Marshall
6,4, Subway Wars," Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.",Lily

6,5, Architect of Destruction," I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.",Ted

6,5, Architect of Destruction, I can't design the building.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, yeah.",Marshall

6,5, Architect of Destruction," As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm.",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Please stop calling yourself ""Papa.""",Lily

6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Kids, as you may remember, Max was a friend of Marshall's from law school... with whom Robin was really starting to hit it off.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness.,Marshall

6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, the small pen1s thing?",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him ""Max.""",Marshall

6,5, Architect of Destruction, Just don't!,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You're kidding me.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Snakes.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Did you just say ""snakes""?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, New is always better?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Everything.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?",Ted

6,5, Architect of Destruction," Your call, buddy.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. ""Hey, look how big my cell phone is!"" You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Lily told you.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Told him what?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Max has a small pen1s.,Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, How can you speak of such things?,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Girls talk about everything.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation...",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, How can you speak of such things?,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I do not do that.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, My friend Lori from work...,Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Duh. Of course there's a girl.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Boobs?,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Beautiful building, right?",Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow.,Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices...",Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction, She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Whose dream?,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, We wound up talking for hours.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.,Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.",Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.,Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tranny before, but it's still sweet.",Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hey, Ted, can I ask you something",Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Anything.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian"" We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?",Woman
6,5, Architect of Destruction, And you said...?,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Where do I sign?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," And what did this ""Zoey"" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," So what do you do, Ted?",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I'm a veterinarian.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, What? I panicked!,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I don't do that.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...]  Look, she's really hot, okay?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Asian girls love them some Jews.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, And you're welcome.,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," No. Technically, they were eggs.",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Did you just say ""eggs""?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," I don't recall saying ""eggs.""",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? ""The motion of the ocean."" That whole thing.",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Let's order!,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction,...the strangest thing happened.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I need your help.  Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal.,Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Wasn't expecting bunnies.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, ""Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay.""",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Totally.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, We'll just be here. You're great.,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I know.,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Damn, baby, be cool!",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You're acting like he has six months to live.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about s*x?,Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Yes, we do, but you know what we say? ""I hit that.""""I got some.""""I tapped it."" ""I squeezed those."" Discreet and efficient.",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Not to mention classy.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our s*x life, I'd probably kill myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Are you sure?,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy.,Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Wow. You're a little bit crazy.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box.",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Solid C-cup, perky bounce.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Momentary grudging respect.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Ted, that is never gonna happen.",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana.",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, bummer!",Man
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Hey.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came.",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with ""Save The Arcadian.""",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," As I looked up at that magnificent old structure, I realized I wasn't letting my feelings for Zoey mislead me. This building really was worth saving.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Ted, everything okay? Yea... um... um... You work for GNB?",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?",Man
6,5, Architect of Destruction," She was really hot, okay?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, How the hell could you do that?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," The billboard, Barney.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You named the rabbit?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.",Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, So you're back in?,Barney
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Yeah.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," That night, as I worked on a new design that just might solve all my problems... Marshall was visited by a disturbing vision.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Uh, it looks disgusting.",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Uh, is this working for you?",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," ""Uh, is this working for you?""",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, you're bad.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, More Cosmos?,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Are you married?,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved?",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction, This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Yeah, it was about the girl.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Snakes?,Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction, I don't recall saying snakes.,Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, ""I can't do this,"" and storms out.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Wow, that is weird.",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction, But here's the crazier part.,Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?",Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Yup. ""'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the..."" I can't read that, baby.",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction," ""Musky scent of man.""",Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," ""As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.""",Lily
6,5, Architect of Destruction, That sounds real.,Robin
6,5, Architect of Destruction," And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!",Zoey
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,5, Architect of Destruction, How's it going with Robin?,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction, Really? Why? You with her?,Marshall
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Hey, what's not for everyone?",Ted
6,5, Architect of Destruction," Guys, come on. What is it?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," So, have you guys landed on a name yet?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.,Claudia
6,6, Baby Talk, I know.,Claudia
6,6, Baby Talk," Oh, that's good. No, no, no, no. Let's call her ""Vodka."" Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go!",Claudia
6,6, Baby Talk," Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a...",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Emily.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Lisa.,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Lisa?!,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Emily?!,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid ""LeBron,"" and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Then I'm also crossing off, um, ""Shaquille""... Mm-hmm. ""Hakeem,"" and ""Dikembe."" Hey, what about ""Rob""?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," ""Rob""? No.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Why not?,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Not ""Rob.""",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," um, how about ""Ryan""?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Ooh.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Not ""Ryan.""",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," ""Johnny?""",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, where's the goldfish?",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Not ""Johnny."" Or ""Gil.""",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," ""Jeremy.""",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Jeremy, no!",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Definitely not ""Jeremy."" His stuff was so derivative.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Well, I mean, geez, Lily.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby ""Becky,"" right?",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Why? What?,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Oh, honey, I really try.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how ""awful"" Becky is, so last night I checked it out.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Peace talks in the region have been described as, ""productive."" Becky?",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Well, if you read the story, we might find out.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Mmm...  I thought she was charming.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, You want the long version or the short version?,Barney
6,6, Baby Talk, Short version.,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Short version. Who's your daddy?,Barney
6,6, Baby Talk," You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Wow. That is disgusting.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Challenge accepted.,Barney
6,6, Baby Talk, No.,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.",Barney
6,6, Baby Talk, Okay. Here's my list of baby names.,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Oh.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," What about ""Tara""?",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," No. Not ""Tara."" Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Not ""Tara.""",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," What about ""Esther""?",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance.",Barney
6,6, Baby Talk, Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, That was my card!,Barney
6,6, Baby Talk," Not ""Esther."" I need a drink. Ted? Ted?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther -- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie.  Who's your daddy?",Barney
6,6, Baby Talk, I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," It's not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Marshall? Is that you?,Judy
6,6, Baby Talk,"Oh, okay, um... You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Sure. You want anything, Marshall?",Judy
6,6, Baby Talk," I'm in a computer, Mom.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Oh.,Judy
6,6, Baby Talk," Okay... No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's any scientific data to support--",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Mike!,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk,Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk,"In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Ow!,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, Aww...,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, I don't know if that's totally true.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," It's okay, little darlin'.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk,"  Yeah, I slept.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.,Barney
6,6, Baby Talk,"  Wow, lady. You got some tig ol' bitties! Gosh! Your body's a perfect... this many.  Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!",Barney
6,6, Baby Talk," Mm, I just need two seconds, baby.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," I know you think that's a compliment, but I'd rather you took your time.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," No, um... I'll be right back.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, This is ridiculous. ,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk,"  Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend? His name's Otis. Hey, hey, want to come to my house and play telephone? I got the string; you got the cans.  I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited.",Barney
6,6, Baby Talk," Yeah, we don't care about this...",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk,  I'm sorry.,Barney
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing.",Man
6,6, Baby Talk, Challenge accept...,Barney
6,6, Baby Talk," Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk," Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, Needed?  She makes training wheels feel needed.,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, You two and your football.,Judy
6,6, Baby Talk, Okay.  Mm-hmm.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Eriksen!,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Come on! You always took charge of everything.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, I got this.,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Thanks.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, This okay? Am I hurting y...,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, I got this. Whoa!,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.,Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, I got this.,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk, Did that really bother you?,Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.",Ted
6,6, Baby Talk, I got this.,Robin

6,6, Baby Talk," Wait... hey, baby, why are you facing me north? You're trying to make us have a boy.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," I... can ex... How do you know about the north thing? Um, um... And what are you doing with those lemons?",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, You're trying to make us have a girl! You are trying to make us have a girl.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled ""how to make a girl some really weird stuff came up but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception... eat a lemon......and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees.  Ooh... ah... Oh, that's not bad.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Lily, how could you do... exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one.",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys.,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Oh, well, what about Chucky?",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Okay, A) He was a doll; B) He was possessed by an adult serial killer; and C) How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?",Marshall

6,6, Baby Talk," That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.",Robin
6,6, Baby Talk," Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say ""Who's your daddy?"" to Robin Scherbatsky.

And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.",Barney
6,6, Baby Talk," Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?",Robin

6,6, Baby Talk," Uh, well,vthe other night she ran a really high fever.",Claudia
6,6, Baby Talk," We looked at each other and, well, we just knew. Our baby's name is... Esther.",Claudia
6,6, Baby Talk, Esther? That's beautiful.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, We're idiots.,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," Baby, names and gender, it's just, like... it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound--",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Whoa.,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Ten-pound? Eight-pound?,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my v*g1n* can't cash.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, I love you. And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have.,Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk," Me, too.",Lily
6,6, Baby Talk," You know what? We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy. Like, um...",Marshall
6,6, Baby Talk, Marshall... we just named our baby. Jamie.,Lily
6,6, Baby Talk, Not Jamie.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," And so, due to one architectural oversight, the Toledo Bridge Disaster of 1906 claimed the lives of 75 people. Now, I hate to stop while I'm on a roll, but happy Halloween, ya crazies!",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Nah, I got a thing. But you kids have fun trick or treating. This is a treat.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Did it hurt?,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, What?,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam.",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy," Hey, guys.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Hey, Randy. Uh, you want a beer?",Marshall

6,7, Canning Randy, I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.,Barney

6,7, Canning Randy, No! Damn it! I'm leaving.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, But she might stop by later.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," I guess I can hang out a little longer. So, anyone going to see the Halloween parade?",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, we were big fans of New York's annual Halloween parade. I don't mean the one that takes place Halloween night in the Village. I mean the one that takes place the morning of November 1st, the Annual Post Halloween Walk of Shame Parade.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy," Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups.",Marshall

6,7, Canning Randy, I don't want to talk about it.,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy, Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, My co-anchor's a woman.,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy, Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. ,Barney
6,7, Canning Randy," Robin had always believed that the key to success was intelligence, hard work and professionalism. Her new co-anchor Becky had a different philosophy.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy, You did a commercial?,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy, You're a journalist! Don't you want to be taken seriously?,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Okay, well, if you really think this is going to help your image.",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Hi, Becky. Boats, boats, boats! Robin, a little help here?",Mike
6,7, Canning Randy," Robin, you gotta not worry so much about being liked.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, easy for you to say. Everybody loves you at your job.",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," That was true of my teaching job. But I was also designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, and well...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy," Ted Mosby, we don't like you! What do you have to say for yourself, tearing down a beautiful, old building just to put up a stupid band headquarters?",Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy, Hmm... Boo... freakin'... hoo.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Boo freakin' hoo? That's it? The Arcadian is an architecturally significant...,Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy," Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Shampoo. You should try it sometime.,Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy, You don't know the first thing about architecture.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Key - Ted Mosby's car. Go on.,Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy," I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, good, the eggs are here.",Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, I should head up.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," No, GNB was not popular. That's why every year they produced a feel-good video to improve the bank's image.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy, I care about our precious Earth.,Barney
6,7, Canning Randy, I care about old people.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," I care about high-yield offshore investments. And so does Tugboat here. Isn't that right, Tugboat?",Man
6,7, Canning Randy," Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," All you have to do is say ""I care about making dreams come true.""",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy," First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.,Barney
6,7, Canning Randy," I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that?,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, They never arrived at the downtown office.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," They... Well, just to make sure we're on the same page is ""send them downtown"" not an expression for shredding a document?",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, You shredded them?!,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, whoa, you're wearing a green tie now. I'm wearing a green tie.",Arthur
6,7, Canning Randy," GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Uh, just want you to know, we are making good progress on this new project.  Oh, you gentlemen keep talking, I will answer that. Marshall Eriksen's office. [...] Yeah, I can get that for you. [...] Just a second. Uh... bank. The ""B"" stands for bank. Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight. Oh, yikes. I'd better get Mr. Messy a napkin. ",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, Period.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, Just tell me who you slept with!,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Lily, I don't want to get into it, okay?",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Aha, it's someone we know. If it was some ding dong we didn't know, you'd just give me his name.",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, Fine. It's Bill Pepper.,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy, Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? It's someone we know!,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions?",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Yes. How do you sleep at night?,Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy, What are you doing here?,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," It was recently made clear to me that I don't know the first thing about architecture, so here I am.",Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy," Very well, then, let's get started.  Some examples of Greek Revival architecture...",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Ooh! Ooh! Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?,Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy, No.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building that Professor Mosby wants to tear down.",Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy, Getting back to Greek Revival...,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, I lost them.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley...",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, Johnny? Johnny!,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, We're familiar with it.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, Shuts them right up.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, baby, what's wrong?",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, Something bad happened.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Randy, hey, have you seen the...",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Before you get to that, regarding the earlier project I was working on... Voil&agrave;!",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, That's the Hermanson contract?,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No...  Anyway, what's your thing?",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, I need the Filbert contract!,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy, You slept with Randy!,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, What?!,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, ""Boats! Boats! Boats!"" So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition.",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, That's...exactly what happened.,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy," Randy, hey, what's going on?",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, I just wanted to say no hard feelings.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, Thank you. So where you headed now?,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, Downtown. ,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, No!!,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," It's okay, baby.",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, It wasn't okay. So the next morning...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy," Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.,Arthur
6,7, Canning Randy," No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say ""GNB Cares,"" and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.",Arthur
6,7, Canning Randy, Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...",Arthur
6,7, Canning Randy," No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.",Arthur
6,7, Canning Randy," Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Boo... freakin'...,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack.,Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy," The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?,Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy, No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy, And did it work?,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Hey, guys.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy murdered him.",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy, No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," I'm trying to eat here, buddy.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, You didn't sleep with her?,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, So why are you smiling?,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, I'll tell you why.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, This just isn't working out.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Randy, great news! You're not fired!",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Good morning, everybody... Where's my class?",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Hello, Professor. Ha-boom.",Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy," I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, I-I can't. I need my severance check.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, Thanks. It brings out my eyes.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.,Arthur
6,7, Canning Randy," Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, we'll see about that.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. ""We care about making dreams come true,"" in three, two...",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy, No!,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, What are you doing?,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, And there's more.,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy," I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy, Now am I fired?,Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy," Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.",Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy, That's just the pick-me-up I needed.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?",Barney
6,7, Canning Randy, Hello.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, I like my teachers.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy,"...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, Was there more to that story?,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, A little bit.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Lily, you're a psychopath.",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," A little bit. Oh, a panda!",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us?",Zoey
6,7, Canning Randy," Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an ""F.""",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, You said that?,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought ""F"" had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?",Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, Yeah.,Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Hey, guys.",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Robin, who'd you sleep with?",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy, I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,7, Canning Randy," Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy, What... Why didn't you tell us?,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy, I'm going to the bathroom right now.,Robin
6,7, Canning Randy," Say... ""Ah...""",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy, Wow! I can't wait to see it.,Ted
6,7, Canning Randy," Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.",Robin
6,7, Canning Randy, It ran for seven years.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy," Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream, big-time lawyer at a huge corporation.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, You think working here is my dream?,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk.",Randy
6,7, Canning Randy, Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.,Marshall
6,7, Canning Randy," Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,7, Canning Randy, I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?,Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Key Ted Mosby's car.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a ""fat cat."" Me and my ""fat-cat friends."" We're not fat cats.",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?",Barney
6,8, Natural History," Impeccable, old bean. To industry!",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Ah, bully!",Barney
6,8, Natural History," Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,8, Natural History," Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.,Ted
6,8, Natural History," Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Nice monkey suit, Russell.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.,Robin
6,8, Natural History," Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.",Barney
6,8, Natural History," Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, ""Don't touch anything"". To a kid. That's like someone telling us ""Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.""",Barney
6,8, Natural History, Not bad.,Robin
6,8, Natural History," So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",Barney
6,8, Natural History," Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.",Robin
6,8, Natural History, It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?,Barney
6,8, Natural History," Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot.",Arthur
6,8, Natural History, The Captain?,Marshall
6,8, Natural History, The Captain?,Barney
6,8, Natural History," Back in school we met during a production of Guys and Dolls. The Captain was Nathan Detroit to my assistant stage manager. Marshall and Barney here, are the future of Goliath National Bank.",Arthur
6,8, Natural History, Ahoy.,Barney
6,8, Natural History," Ahoy, The Captain.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig.,Arthur
6,8, Natural History," Thank you, The Captain.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Challenge accepted.,Barney
6,8, Natural History," Wow. ""The future of Goliath National Bank""?",Lily
6,8, Natural History," I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...",Lily
6,8, Natural History, I think I'm going to say yes.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Ah, that's the stuff.",Barney
6,8, Natural History," I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.",Robin
6,8, Natural History, Impressive. Try this on for size.,Barney
6,8, Natural History, You want to dance? Let's dance.,Robin
6,8, Natural History, I live for the dance.,Barney
6,8, Natural History, Get... your other hand... off my ass.,Robin
6,8, Natural History," Sorry, sorry.",Barney
6,8, Natural History," What do you mean, you're going to say yes?",Lily
6,8, Natural History, I-I want to keep working at GNB.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History, But I thought that you...,Lily
6,8, Natural History, But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.,Lily
6,8, Natural History," Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Zoey? Well, well, well.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, You have got to be kidding me.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?",Ted
6,8, Natural History," And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first?",Zoey
6,8, Natural History," Ted, this is my husband.",Zoey
6,8, Natural History," Yeah, old stuff's great.",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?",Robin
6,8, Natural History," This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.",Barney
6,8, Natural History, You're right.,Robin
6,8, Natural History, Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?,Barney
6,8, Natural History," Yeah, I do.",Robin
6,8, Natural History," So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, This is Ted.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, She!,Ted
6,8, Natural History," Yes. The sea is all like, ""Ted, come hang out.""",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, You're going down.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?",Ted
6,8, Natural History, So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?,Lily
6,8, Natural History," That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Wieners and gonads.,Ted
6,8, Natural History, What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?,Lily
6,8, Natural History," Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Boogers.,Ted
6,8, Natural History," We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell ""women"" with a ""Y"" anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, So how long have you felt this way?,Lily
6,8, Natural History, Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Hershey squirts.,Ted
6,8, Natural History," Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.",Robin
6,8, Natural History," Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?",Ted
6,8, Natural History, Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History, Good luck killing James Bond.  Are we allowed in here?,Ted
6,8, Natural History, What do you want from me?,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, My life isn't perfect.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.",Ted
6,8, Natural History, It did.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,8, Natural History," You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, What?,Lily
6,8, Natural History," So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?",Lily
6,8, Natural History, Affirmatootly.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History, And become an environmental lawyer?,Lily
6,8, Natural History, Yepskerdoodles.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf?",Lily
6,8, Natural History, Posititochadochmecochepopocha.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Lawyered.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History," Okay, that's also a made-up word.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Niled it.,Barney
6,8, Natural History, Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.,Barney
6,8, Natural History, I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History, He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.,Ted
6,8, Natural History," I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building.",Zoey
6,8, Natural History," It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Ted, that was... really easy.",Zoey
6,8, Natural History, What?,Ted
6,8, Natural History, This should be useful.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,8, Natural History, You tricked me.,Ted
6,8, Natural History," Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime.",Zoey
6,8, Natural History, I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?,Robin
6,8, Natural History," Oh, yeah, that story is legend...  Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?",Barney
6,8, Natural History, Thank you.,Barney
6,8, Natural History," Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche.",Arthur
6,8, Natural History, She caught me on tape trashing GNB.,Ted
6,8, Natural History, Really? You'd do that to your own wife?,Ted
6,8, Natural History," No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Kids, there's an amazing architectural phenomenon in the Natural History Museum. If you stand in the right spot, you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,8, Natural History," Who's the master, Leroy?",Barney
6,8, Natural History," Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.",Barney
6,8, Natural History, Jerry's my uncle.,Barney
6,8, Natural History, I want you.,Lily
6,8, Natural History,"No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.",Lily
6,8, Natural History, No.,Lily
6,8, Natural History," Yes, but I'm okay with that.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.",Lily
6,8, Natural History," Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.",Lily
6,8, Natural History, Sure.,Lily
6,8, Natural History, Hey.,Marshall
6,8, Natural History, Hi.,Lily
6,8, Natural History," Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?",Marshall
6,8, Natural History, We'll make it work.,Lily
6,8, Natural History, So when was the last time you saw him?,Robin
6,8, Natural History," It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.",Barney
6,8, Natural History, Moms.,Robin
6,8, Natural History, He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.,Barney
6,8, Natural History," Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...",Robin
6,8, Natural History," But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.",Barney
6,8, Natural History," Barney, do you want...?",Robin
6,8, Natural History," I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?",Barney
6,8, Natural History," I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?",Ted
6,8, Natural History, Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing?,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," Oh, I thought we were...",Ted
6,8, Natural History, Fine. I erased the tape.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History, What?,Ted
6,8, Natural History, I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History, Thanks.,Ted
6,8, Natural History, But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman.,Zoey
6,8, Natural History," You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.",Ted
6,8, Natural History," Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs.",Zoey
6,8, Natural History," Bring it on, Princess.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.",Lily
6,9, Glitter, They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Look at this crib.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,9, Glitter," Oh, you're wearing a flower.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, Thank you.,Barney
6,9, Glitter," Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, I know. Isn't it?,Barney
6,9, Glitter, Why are you wearing that?,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Why does Barney do anything ever?,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The ""everyday boutonniere"" by Stinson.",Barney
6,9, Glitter," And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.,Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for ""bootie is near?"" True story. Une histoire vraie.",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for ""sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid""""",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Woman, you best check yourself.",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!,Barney
6,9, Glitter," What, are we gonna duel?",Robin
6,9, Glitter," No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,9, Glitter, I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!,Barney
6,9, Glitter," Oh, you haven't watched it yet?",Marshall
6,9, Glitter," No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.",Lily
6,9, Glitter, Space Teens?! Is this a porno?,Barney
6,9, Glitter," No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.",Robin
6,9, Glitter," I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p0rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, That sounds ridiculous.,Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",Robin
6,9, Glitter, You can't do that on television.,Marshall
6,9, Glitter, Exactly.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, No. You can't do that on television!,Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",Robin
6,9, Glitter," I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter," You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?",Man
6,9, Glitter, Yes! Oh! Seven times four?,Man
6,9, Glitter, Keep going! Eight times nine?,Man
6,9, Glitter, Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?,Man
6,9, Glitter," I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, But BFFs are forever.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, I'm still friends with Punchy.,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",Ted
6,9, Glitter, Schmosby!,Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Punchy!,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",Ted
6,9, Glitter, Definitely.,Punchy
6,9, Glitter, We are just two peas.,Ted
6,9, Glitter, I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",Ted
6,9, Glitter," Four years, three months.",Lily
6,9, Glitter, Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.,Ted
6,9, Glitter, Of course. Robin hates kids.,Marshall
6,9, Glitter, The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,Barney
6,9, Glitter," Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, ""To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, Robin's gonna dump me!,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, sweetheart.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, When a second uterus plumped becomes...,Ted
6,9, Glitter, Dude. Feel the room.,Marshall
6,9, Glitter, No.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, We've been waiting all day!,Ted
6,9, Glitter, Just watch it without me.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Two dudes on the couch together watching p0rn? That's kind of weird.,Barney
6,9, Glitter," Okay, it's not p0rn, it's a kids' show.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, We...,Barney
6,9, Glitter, I'm serious.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Our characters had pet beavers.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Sure.,Ted
6,9, Glitter, The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, It's a noble creature.,Barney
6,9, Glitter," Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?",Man
6,9, Glitter," Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",Robin
6,9, Glitter, No arguments here.,Barney
6,9, Glitter, 'Sup Shmosby!,Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Punchy, what are you doing here?",Ted
6,9, Glitter," Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?",Ted
6,9, Glitter,"In your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?,Robin
6,9, Glitter," I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.,Ted
6,9, Glitter, Don't care.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.,Ted
6,9, Glitter, Get a hotel.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Robin... LeBron.,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Okay, one night. Got to go.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Where are you going? We just got here.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, a Korean massage.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, By yourself?,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",Ted
6,9, Glitter," Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, I don't.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Lily, how old am I?",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, 384 months.,Lily
6,9, Glitter, Busted!,Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,9, Glitter," Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Crib...,Lily
6,9, Glitter, What's the matter? You look rattled.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Rattled? I want to talk about babies.,Lily
6,9, Glitter, What?,Robin
6,9, Glitter," Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, What's that supposed to mean?,Lily
6,9, Glitter," It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",Robin
6,9, Glitter," Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",Lily
6,9, Glitter, Great.,Robin
6,9, Glitter, Great.,Lily
6,9, Glitter, For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?,Marshall
6,9, Glitter," I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you ""accidentally"" shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, No!,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?,Lily
6,9, Glitter," You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, Okay.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, Times Square's the bomb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.,Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",Ted
6,9, Glitter, They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?,Punchy
6,9, Glitter, No.,Ted
6,9, Glitter, Times Square's the bomb!,Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?",Ted
6,9, Glitter, I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.,Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, ""You are the weakest link. Goodbye."" Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Okay, yeah. I know.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",Barney
6,9, Glitter," Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter, That's your scrotum.,Ted
6,9, Glitter," You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Yeah, he's gotta go.",Ted
6,9, Glitter, What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, How did you find Glitter?,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter, More like ex-best friends. Just like you.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",Lily
6,9, Glitter, What? Why?,Lily
6,9, Glitter, Charge!,Marshall
6,9, Glitter, Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",Lily
6,9, Glitter," Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here?",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Punchy, it's time to go back.",Ted
6,9, Glitter, Back to Times Square?!,Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter, You worry about me?,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Yeah. The other day, when you called...",Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Schmosby!,Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Punchy!,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...",Ted
6,9, Glitter, Definitely.,Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Sweetie, who was that?",Woman
6,9, Glitter, It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed.,Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?,Woman
6,9, Glitter," Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.",Woman
6,9, Glitter, You think that would work?,Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Worked on me.,Woman
6,9, Glitter," Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.",Punchy
6,9, Glitter, Of course I will.,Ted
6,9, Glitter," Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Oh, that's it...",Punchy
6,9, Glitter," That night, Lily went to the one place she knew she could find Robin-- New York's premiere Canadian bar, the Hoser Hut.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,9, Glitter," Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.",Lily
6,9, Glitter," No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...",Robin
6,9, Glitter, I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.,Lily
6,9, Glitter," Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.",Robin
6,9, Glitter, I'm so happy you guys made up.,Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Me, too.",Ted
6,9, Glitter, Where do I know this song from?,Barney
6,9, Glitter," Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?",Robin
6,9, Glitter, Wow. This is so dirty.,Barney
6,9, Glitter," Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.",Marshall
6,9, Glitter," Yeah, dude, come on.",Ted
6,9, Glitter," *Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...*",Robin
6,13, Bad News," We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children.",Lily
6,13, Bad News, Six days.,Lily
6,13, Bad News," But then, months went by, and still nothing happened.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,13, Bad News, Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot.,Lily
6,13, Bad News," And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected s*x day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.",Barney
6,13, Bad News, I'm not playing laser tag.,Marshall
6,13, Bad News, I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.,Ted
6,13, Bad News, Damn it.,Marshall
6,13, Bad News, And Marshall's the winner.,Barney
6,13, Bad News," Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," So Aunt Lily went to see Dr. John Stangel, the man who knew more about human reproduction than anyone in New York City.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,13, Bad News," Yeah, and it cuts in and out.",Barney
6,13, Bad News, Ooh! How did you do it?,Lily
6,13, Bad News," Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?",Barney
6,13, Bad News, What are you talking about?,Lily
6,13, Bad News, What are you talking about?,Barney
6,13, Bad News, My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.,Lily
6,13, Bad News," Just one, ""Dr. Stangel"". Where'd you get the beard?",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?",Lily
6,13, Bad News, Not today I wasn't.,Barney
6,13, Bad News," Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney.",Ted
6,13, Bad News," Uh, Marshall?",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.",Lily
6,13, Bad News, I still kind of think it's Barney.,Lily
6,13, Bad News, There's no way it's Barney.,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.",Barney
6,13, Bad News, Okay. Convinced.,Lily
6,13, Bad News," ""Suit up""... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Baby, you just saw Barney.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit?,Lily
6,13, Bad News," Oh, yeah... Bjorney.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!",Barney
6,13, Bad News, Thank you.,Lily
6,13, Bad News," Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!",Barney
6,13, Bad News, Can we leave him in here for a while?,Lily
6,13, Bad News," Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!",Barney
6,13, Bad News," Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,13, Bad News," So, first day of work?",Ted

6,13, Bad News, It gets worse.,Robin
6,13, Bad News," Sandy, this is...",Woman
6,13, Bad News, Robin.,Sandy
6,13, Bad News, You two know each other?,Woman
6,13, Bad News, Know each other? We've had s*x.,Sandy
6,13, Bad News, You had s*x with Sandy Rivers?,Ted
6,13, Bad News," No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show.",Robin
6,13, Bad News, Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?,Ted
6,13, Bad News," Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.",Robin
6,13, Bad News," Hey, babe.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Yeah, uh, we got a game of ""Go Fish"" going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from?",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile.,Lily
6,13, Bad News," You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.",Lily
6,13, Bad News, Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.,Barney
6,13, Bad News," So, second day of work?",Ted
6,13, Bad News, What's wrong?,Lily
6,13, Bad News," Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.",Ted
6,13, Bad News," Already? Oh, honey.",Lily
6,13, Bad News, I wish I was the office slut.,Robin
6,13, Bad News, And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq.,Robin
6,13, Bad News, Yes. We definitely had s*x.,Sandy
6,13, Bad News, We did not have s*x.,Robin
6,13, Bad News, Then why do I remember you?,Sandy
6,13, Bad News," I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional.",Robin
6,13, Bad News," No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have s*x.",Sandy
6,13, Bad News, Thank you.,Robin
6,13, Bad News, You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop...,Sandy
6,13, Bad News, We did have s*x.,Robin
6,13, Bad News," Oh, I... I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor.",Sandy
6,13, Bad News, But this reporter takes pride in...,Robin
6,13, Bad News, And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny.,Robin
6,13, Bad News," Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney guns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",Barney
6,13, Bad News," Oh, it's my dad.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, Aren't you going to get it?,Ted
6,13, Bad News," No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, He has to do that?,Ted
6,13, Bad News, But I thought you talk to your dad about everything.,Robin
6,13, Bad News," I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, I'm getting married!,Marshall
6,13, Bad News, I passed the bar!,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp!,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," I'll show you. ""Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion"".",Barney
6,13, Bad News," Barney, I've already told...",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," ""Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome"".",Barney
6,13, Bad News," So, third day of work?",Ted
6,13, Bad News," And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...",Robin
6,13, Bad News, Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius.,Sandy
6,13, Bad News," Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.",Robin
6,13, Bad News, A few?,Sandy
6,13, Bad News," Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one.",Robin
6,13, Bad News, Gregory.,Sandy
6,13, Bad News," Oh, God. What did they find?",Ted
6,13, Bad News, Everything.,Robin
6,13, Bad News," *Everybody, come and play*... I'm a dirty, dirty girl... *Throw every last care away; Let's go to the mall today; Today, today*...

6,13, Bad News, They even found the video of me getting attacked by an owl.,Robin
6,13, Bad News, You got attacked by an owl?,Ted
6,13, Bad News, I did not get attacked by an owl.,Robin
6,13, Bad News," Robin, listen, here's what you need to do...",Ted
6,13, Bad News," Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job.",Robin
6,13, Bad News," Kids, at that moment, I knew what I had to do for my friend Robin. But first I had to do something for me.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,13, Bad News," Show me ""owl attack"".",Ted
6,13, Bad News, I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot.,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I... Could I take this home?",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News, Surprise!,Judy
6,13, Bad News, Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here?,Marshall
6,13, Bad News, We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you.,Judy
6,13, Bad News," Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute?",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well... Wait, wait, wait. Marshall.",Lily
6,13, Bad News," Thank you, baby. You're the best.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Marshall. Marshall. I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer. It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine? Me in a two-piece bathing suit at my age? Just picture it! Picture it!",Judy
6,13, Bad News," Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address.",Ted
6,13, Bad News, Who?,Robin
6,13, Bad News," Sorry. You said ""who"". It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. ""Who"". Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.",Ted
6,13, Bad News," Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there.",Robin
6,13, Bad News, I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.,Ted
6,13, Bad News," Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists.",Robin
6,13, Bad News, They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.,Ted
6,13, Bad News, Ah... You're not the pizza guy.,Sandy
6,13, Bad News," Oh, my God. This is...",Robin
6,13, Bad News," This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down.",Ted
6,13, Bad News, If people found out Sandy wears a toupee...,Robin
6,13, Bad News, Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?,Ted
6,13, Bad News," Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy.",Robin
6,13, Bad News," And the top is so low-cut. Your father says he has front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins. Oh. Oh. By the way, Marshall, we do need to know if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming? Marshall? Marshall, are you coming?",Judy
6,13, Bad News, This isn't working.,Marshall

6,13, Bad News, Lily!,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Marshall, just tell them what's going on.",Lily
6,13, Bad News, And so Marshall told his parents everything.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,13, Bad News," And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Aw, Marshall. Hey, we don't care about that one bit. And if you guys want kids, there are other ways. Adoption. Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm?",Judy
6,13, Bad News," Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption.",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Wait, you knew?",Marshall
6,13, Bad News," We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.",Judy
6,13, Bad News, So? Possibly last day of work?,Ted
6,13, Bad News," Actually, it was a good day.",Robin
6,13, Bad News," And I need more numbers on how the holiday season impacted the economy. Sparkles, got anything on malls?",Sandy
6,13, Bad News," Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see.",Robin
6,13, Bad News, Yes! Put him in a body bag!,Ted
6,13, Bad News," Okay, I didn't do it.",Robin
6,13, Bad News, What?,Ted
6,13, Bad News, I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of...,Robin
6,13, Bad News, Owl?,Ted
6,13, Bad News," Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice.",Robin
6,13, Bad News," That day, Robin decided to steer into the skid. And though she never quite shook the nickname, Sparkles went on to do very well at World Wide News. Especially after this happened.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,13, Bad News," After his parents had gone back to Minnesota, Marshall got the results of his test.",Future Ted(Narrator)

6,13, Bad News, It's just...,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?",Marshall

6,13, Bad News, And?,Marshall
6,13, Bad News, My sperm is fine!,Marshall
6,13, Bad News," Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!",Barney

6,13, Bad News," You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it?",Marshall

6,24, Challenge Accepted, I want to press it!,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, ""Baby, that was great"""" and go to sleep.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates.",Zoey
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win.",Zoey
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Hey. You want to get coffee sometime?,Zoey
6,24, Challenge Accepted," You know that ""coffee"" is code for ""I want to get back together"" right?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I want to get back together.,Zoey
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I'm not letting you press the button.,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I want to press the button!,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You're not pressing the button! It's my button!,Ted

6,24, Challenge Accepted," Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, ""Get sick, get a free gallon of soup"".",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's surprise soup and headed back to work to introduce the new class pet.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,24, Challenge Accepted," This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with...  Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You okay?,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," 50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Ah, but ""new is always better"" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hi, Marsh.",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Oh, hey, buddy.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Hey. Everything okay?,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.",Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Of course, baby. ",Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...",Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.",Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Um, I...",Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather,"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I bet it's her tushie.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I got you this job, so I... Say what?",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. ,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You...,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. ""See you in an hour.""",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Who's that from?,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Uh, Ted's gone back for less.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Bro.,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Ted, I only have one rule.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," But I can't reach the worst part.  Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Get it together, bro.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Don't worry. I'll be prepared.,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted, We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... ,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Aw, that's sweet.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You weren't listening either?,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Damn it, Marshall.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Okay, we're never gonna find him.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Got it. Ted's at...  Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.,Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, That's the intersection.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Way ahead of ya.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Hello!,Ranjit
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Marshall. Jake Bloom. Great to meet you.,Man
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hello, hi.",Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I know. They're a total train wreck.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Unmitigated disaster.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Worst couple ever.,Ranjit
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Yeah, almost as bad as us.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I guess I get it.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, What do you mean?,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Yeah, she did.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Smith and Ninth Street.,Ranjit
6,24, Challenge Accepted, That's a seal.,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Mm-hmm.,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Okay, where the hell are they?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Maybe this isn't the intersection.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so... whatever.",Man
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Wait. Where'd you get that? ,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?",Man
6,24, Challenge Accepted, She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge.,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," When it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends! ,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Nailed it.,Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. Ooh! Come on. What the hell?!",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.",Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted, But... it's a mistake.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," You're right.  Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough.  No. Hi.",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, And kids... that's how I met your mother. Psych. It was just some chick.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hey, baby, how'd it go?",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Baby, come here.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. ,Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted, And Marshall slept...all night.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,24, Challenge Accepted, He is.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, You sure?,Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Yeah. You earned it.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Hey, new is always better, right?",Ted
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Always.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick.",Marshall
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I know, baby. I'm pregnant.",Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted, I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.,Robin
6,24, Challenge Accepted," It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please?  Norah.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, How you been?,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted," I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.",Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Challenge accepted.,Barney
6,24, Challenge Accepted, Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
6,24, Challenge Accepted," Geez, what now?  I heard the groom needed me.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, I just have...,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, Thank you.,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks," Actually, it a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks, So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?,Zoey
6,23, Landmarks," That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.",Zoey
6,23, Landmarks," I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.",Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like...,Zoey
6,23, Landmarks, Nice.,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, I have a message from Barney.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks, Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,Zoey
6,23, Landmarks, And then this happened.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks," What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!",Zoey
6,23, Landmarks," Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Which led to this happening.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks," Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you.",Zoey
6,23, Landmarks," Mmm. Love you, too.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...",Lily
6,23, Landmarks," Yeah, I have that, too.",Robin
6,23, Landmarks, Damn it.,Lily
6,23, Landmarks," All right, here's the message.  ""Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and..."" Really? ""Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split.  Do evil laugh."" Oh, um...  So, what are you turds up to?",Robin
6,23, Landmarks," Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.",Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, Why does it need to rhyme?,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.",Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, And she hasn't since.,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?",Barney
6,23, Landmarks, Nailed it.,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks," Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, What?,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.",Lily
6,23, Landmarks, I once knew such a girl.,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, It was last call. In this very bar.,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!,Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.",Robin
6,23, Landmarks," Barney, this is about the building.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Come on. This is so about the girl.,Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?,Lily
6,23, Landmarks," Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be.  That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks," Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks, Isn't that animal cruelty?,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, I'm talking about my wife.,Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Yeah, I know your friend Ted.",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you?  Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you.",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks, Come again for Big Fudge?,Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.",Barney
6,23, Landmarks, I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, I don't understand. Why would you fire me?,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?,Arthur
6,23, Landmarks, By being the best architect available?,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, No.,Arthur
6,23, Landmarks, By... being Latino?,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.,Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.",Barney
6,23, Landmarks, Damn it! I was kidding?,Barney
6,23, Landmarks," I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done.",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks, They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, And he's been doing it for years.,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?",Lily
6,23, Landmarks, No idea.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, He has a lot of keys.,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...",Robin
6,23, Landmarks, There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",Robin
6,23, Landmarks, The chairman asks you...,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, You say...,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, No.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, And Zoey dumps you on the spot.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, We're done here.,Zoey
6,23, Landmarks, There's the second scenario.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, The chairman asks you...,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, You say...,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, Yes,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",Robin
6,23, Landmarks, We're done here.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, You said there was a third scenario.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Right.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, The chairman asks you...,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... ",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Tree?,Lily
6,23, Landmarks," Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",Lily
6,23, Landmarks, Thank you.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",Lily
6,23, Landmarks, Thank you.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks," That night, as I slept soundly...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks," Barney, what are you doing?",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Whoa! Lighting change!,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," Hello, Mr. Lion.",Zoey
6,23, Landmarks," ""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair""""",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," Hey, I met you right......here.",Zoey
6,23, Landmarks, Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab.",Zoey
6,23, Landmarks, Worth every penny.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet...,Zoey
6,23, Landmarks," No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save.,Zoey
6,23, Landmarks, Exactly.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, You okay?,Zoey
6,23, Landmarks, Yeah. Good night.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? ",Zoey
6,23, Landmarks," Yeah, that's me.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...",Ted
6,23, Landmarks, They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, Yeah.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.",Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, We should totally buy a bar!,Barney
6,23, Landmarks, We should absolutely totally buy a bar!,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, It's really the only sensible idea right now.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks," Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.",Marshall
6,23, Landmarks, Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, I'll allow it!,Marshall
6,23, Landmarks," The only court where you show up, then get served.",Barney
6,23, Landmarks, Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.,Robin
6,23, Landmarks, That's not bad.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks, Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.,Lily
6,23, Landmarks," Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.",Ted
6,23, Landmarks," I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen.  And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?",Marshall
6,23, Landmarks," Oh, this ought to be good.",Barney
6,23, Landmarks, And then Lily told us her plan.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks," Oh, this is good!",Barney
6,23, Landmarks, We have to find Arthur right now.,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," Hey, Arthur!",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Oh, cute dog!",Robin
6,23, Landmarks," No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.",Barney
6,23, Landmarks," Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!",Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," Uh... Hey, Arthur?",Barney
6,23, Landmarks, I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?,Arthur
6,23, Landmarks," Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.",Lily
6,23, Landmarks, Fine! What's the idea?,Arthur
6,23, Landmarks, Well...,Lily
6,23, Landmarks," Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,23, Landmarks, Zoey... Zoey!,Ted
6,23, Landmarks," All right, what do you have to say for yourself?",Zoey

6,12, False Positive," Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?",Ted
6,12, False Positive, I am never drinking again.,Robin
6,12, False Positive," No, before that.",Ted
6,12, False Positive," Before that, too.",Ted
6,12, False Positive," I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Well, so could Heads or Tails.  The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on The Bachelor, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on The Biggest Loser, and now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.",Robin
6,12, False Positive," It seemed like there was no changing Robin's mind. But what we didn't know, in that moment, was that our world was about to be turned upside down.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive, I'm pregnant.,Lily
6,12, False Positive, What?!,Robin
6,12, False Positive," Now, kids, when your friends have great news, you're happy for them... For, like, a millisecond. And then you start thinking about yourself.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive," Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job.",Robin
6,12, False Positive," And so, the next night, we had two things to celebrate.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive," Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News.",Robin
6,12, False Positive," Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive, What changed your mind?,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist...  Who gives her beer.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, What?,Lily
6,12, False Positive, What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
6,12, False Positive," Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive, So the next day Robin called Heads or Tails to respectfully decline.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive," Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, But at that moment...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive," As honored as I am by the offer, um...  Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo.,Robin
6,12, False Positive, You took the Heads or tails job?,Ted
6,12, False Positive, Yeah.,Robin
6,12, False Positive," What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.",Ted
6,12, False Positive," Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?",Robin
6,12, False Positive, We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, Where the hell is Barney?,Ted
6,12, False Positive, Where was Barney? Let's back up again.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive," You see, while this was going on...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive,...This was happening.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive, And now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab.,Robin
6,12, False Positive," Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?",Barney
6,12, False Positive, Bon Jovi?,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n?  Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check.",Barney
6,12, False Positive," My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Ted
6,12, False Positive," And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit.",Barney
6,12, False Positive," Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?",Ted
6,12, False Positive," Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang.",Barney
6,12, False Positive," Hey, guys. Big announcement.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too.",Ted
6,12, False Positive," No, just a $30 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Thirty?!,Ted
6,12, False Positive, I'm pregnant.,Lily
6,12, False Positive, What?!,Robin
6,12, False Positive," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
6,12, False Positive, Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?,Barney
6,12, False Positive, we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.,Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight,  is Barney's Favorite Things!",Barney
6,12, False Positive, That was the reaction Barney expected. This was the one he got.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive, Huh? I don't know what that is.,Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?",Barney
6,12, False Positive, The next hour got pretty weird.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive, Velour track suits!,Barney
6,12, False Positive, Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club!  You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more.,Barney
6,12, False Positive, No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.,Ted
6,12, False Positive, I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club.,Barney
6,12, False Positive," The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive," Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless...",Barney
6,12, False Positive, I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.,Barney
6,12, False Positive," No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail.",Barney
6,12, False Positive," I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more.",Barney
6,12, False Positive," Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero...",Barney
6,12, False Positive,"...Zero...  Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars.",Barney
6,12, False Positive," Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me.",Barney
6,12, False Positive, What happened to giving the money away?,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born.  Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!",Barney
6,12, False Positive, It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.",Barney
6,12, False Positive, Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
6,12, False Positive, Let's back up one last time.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,12, False Positive, I'm pregnant.,Lily
6,12, False Positive, What?!,Robin
6,12, False Positive," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
6,12, False Positive," This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," I can. And I'm freaking out, too! There's an alien growing in my stomach that's gonna explode out of my v*g1n*!",Lily
6,12, False Positive, Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out?,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, What am I doing with my life?,Robin
6,12, False Positive, What am I doing with my life?,Barney
6,12, False Positive, I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.,Ted
6,12, False Positive, They're totally onto us. What do we do?,Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense!",Lily
6,12, False Positive, I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell.,Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.",Lily
6,12, False Positive," Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight!",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Let's do it! Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy.",Lily
6,12, False Positive, Nursery's painted!,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Blue? What if it's a girl?,Lily
6,12, False Positive, Damn it!,Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. Can you keep it together?!",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," No, I can't keep it together!",Lily
6,12, False Positive, I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
6,12, False Positive," Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive, This is a nightmare! We've done everything wrong!,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, The iPod was on shuffle!  The Jerky Boys! Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!,Lily
6,12, False Positive," You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful.",Lily
6,12, False Positive," You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Marshall, I don't like this.",Lily
6,12, False Positive," I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away!",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Well, that did it.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Yeah. Huge bummer.,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, So disappointing.,Lily
6,12, False Positive, Are you guys okay?,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing.",Lily
6,12, False Positive," Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Don't reach into the living room!,Lily
6,12, False Positive," Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated.",Ted
6,12, False Positive," Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive," Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all.",Lily
6,12, False Positive," Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.",Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Get a puppy!,Barney
6,12, False Positive, Can you imagine... That would be the cutest thing!,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Oh. Our movie snack.,Barney
6,12, False Positive," Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!",Ted
6,12, False Positive," And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.",Ted
6,12, False Positive," I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!",Barney
6,12, False Positive, Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, Hello.,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Ted, I can't get married!",Punchy

6,12, False Positive," You're right, I do! Thanks, Ted!",Punchy
6,12, False Positive," One for It's a Wonderful Life, please. Thank you.",Ted
6,12, False Positive, We're idiots.,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, This kid doesn't stand a chance.,Lily
6,12, False Positive, We're ready for this.,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, We're ready for this.,Lily
6,12, False Positive, Nope.,Barney
6,12, False Positive," And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon, you'll meet everyone there, but first you need to head down to security. You need to get your picture taken. For your I.D. badge.",Woman
6,12, False Positive, You sure?,Marshall
6,12, False Positive, Positive.,Lily
6,12, False Positive, And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?,Barney
6,12, False Positive," Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas.",Barney
6,12, False Positive, Son?!,Barney
6,12, False Positive, Congratulations.,Ted
6,12, False Positive," You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path.",Robin
6,12, False Positive, It's what I do.,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying...",Robin
6,12, False Positive," Big mistake, but go on.",Ted
6,12, False Positive,"...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?",Robin
6,12, False Positive, Are you asking what I think you're asking?,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Ted, will you be my best man?",Robin
6,12, False Positive, Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.,Ted
6,12, False Positive," Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.",Barney
6,12, False Positive," Um, no.",Woman
6,10, Blitzgiving," Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, A Turturkeykey?,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yeah, I was there for the ""insertion."" He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving," Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Blitz was a guy we knew in college. Sadly, he was cursed.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving, Wh... you sure? We got big plans.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz?",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, We'll see what happens.,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," You see, every time Blitz left a place, something amazing happened.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving, Oh! I'm sorry. I thought this was my room.,Woman
6,10, Blitzgiving, Completely naked!,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Completely naked!,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving, And the movie was awesome.,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," At the exact moment Brando first appeared, ""Weird Al"" launched right into ""Eat It.""",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," And over the years, ""The Curse of The Blitz"" continued.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving, Free beer for everyone!,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Free beer for everyone!,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become... The Blitz.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe ""The Curse of The Blitz"" is real. ",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Kids, I'd live to regret those words. You see, the ""Curse of Blitz"" could be passed from one person to the next, at any moment. Blitz had gotten the curse from Jerry Windheim, back in freshman year, who got it years before that from Davey Beaterman. The original Blitz, Matt Blitz, was a guy who went to Wesleyan back in the '60s. He dropped out right before the school went co-ed. And then, Thanksgiving morning...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving, What the hell happened here?,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey! Morning, Blitz!",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving," Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Please stop. Okay, fine.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving,...To me.,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, The Gentleman!,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's ""The Gentleman""?",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, I'm not The Blitz!  Zoey?,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Morning, Blitz!",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Kids, you remember Zoey. For the last two months, she'd been making my life hell.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving," Thanks, guys! Last night was amazing! The Gentleman!",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving,I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Finish the story, Red.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving, Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, Can I... help you?,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better...",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Well, yeah.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving,  That was you?!,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, Yeah.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Oh! Thanks!,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her.",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving," And then, the craziest thing happened.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, I missed a skateboarding dog?,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, It wasn't?,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare?",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving, Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Best idea ever!,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving, Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, And... send!,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Wait. Blitz was there, too?",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Well, not anymore, Blitz.",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, I tried.,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Renée Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, That's Kate Hudson!,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen?  Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, The oven.,Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," But if it helps, I reached 4G.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny explosion at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving, It's not awesome!,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.,Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Could we bring Ted?,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, No. Absolutely not.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Come on. Give her a chance.,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, No. I c... Because... Step on it.,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, You missed it.,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang ""Twist and Shout!""",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, But he's The Blitz.,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, God, no!",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving, Chicka-chicka!,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Happy Thanksgiving! Ted.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Zoey.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Best friend alert!,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, God, that is disgusting!",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, It's a boom-a-wang.,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, Nice.,Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, Thank you.,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," No, I meant the wang.",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving," Barney, could you get me some more ice?",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, What happened?,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, You missed it!,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, I'm coming with you.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, No... I baste alone.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Who canceled? Your coven?,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Ted, give her a chance.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, Enemies can't become friends.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yes, they can. Right, guys?",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Well, let's get an outside opinion.",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, Who are we gonna...,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," ""Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.""",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...",Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving," Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, What? No. Shut up. I hate him.,Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. ""Yes, enemies can become friends. ""Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'""",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving, I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, What does that have to do with anything?,Robin
6,10, Blitzgiving, Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, my God!",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Did you do that on purpose?,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, What? No. It was an accident.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, great. Real mature.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Yeah, well, you started it.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, get out. All of you, out!",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, But it's Thanksgiving.,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, Out!,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Wait... Where's Barney?,Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving, I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?,Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving, And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving, I guess we're going home.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Lily, where'd you get that?",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? ""Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey."" I wonder who Hannah is.",Lily
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Get out! All of you, out!",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, We have to go back to Zoey's.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, God. What are you doing here?",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Barney let us in.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Aw, man! Wait. Which half?",Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, How do you know that?,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, I just do. It must be tough.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving," It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, Yeah... Right. Next year.,Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.",Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving," Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving," Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.",Marshall
6,10, Blitzgiving," Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen.",Zoey
6,10, Blitzgiving, Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.,Ted
6,10, Blitzgiving, It didn't. It tasted wrong.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving," And just as Barney looked away, it happened.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,10, Blitzgiving, What happened? I saw it!,Barney
6,10, Blitzgiving," Oh, hold the door!",Woman
6,10, Blitzgiving," Thank you, God!",Barney
6,3, Unfinished," Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is ""unfinished."" Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," But first, let's back up a few days.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,3, Unfinished, I don't know. Got a burger coming.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Hi. Barney Stinson.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished," And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, Thank you for your time.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!,Barney
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?",Ted
6,3, Unfinished, That's great. Good for you.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Yeah, thank you.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished, Excuse me?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished,I don't know what you're talking about.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished,There's no poop.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished, Where's the poop?,Lily
6,3, Unfinished,Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, That's great.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, Thank you.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," I am gonna kill you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the killing and eating your face thing.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished, Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished, Prove it. Delete contact.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished, There. Deleted.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Back already. How was flying solo? And by ""solo,"" I mean so low that you got shot down.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished," Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,3, Unfinished," What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, It's my building.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,3, Unfinished," Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished," This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished, No? Are you kidding me?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished, But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?",Ted
6,3, Unfinished, Of course not.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished, All right.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,3, Unfinished," I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished, I need another drink.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished," Marshall, you want anything?",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," No, I'm fine.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Wait, you turned down the job? When?",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, This morning.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Chrissy, I love your glasses.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished, The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.,Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, But Barney hasn't done...,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished," Hey, Lily!",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Don't ""Hey, Lily"" me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, no, not this again.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," Okay, I left Don another message.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," ""This just in"" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, But that's impossible. You deleted his number.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, ""Are you sure?"" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished,"Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," My ""plezh."" If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",Lily
6,3, Unfinished, Super Kicks Karate.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," No, not that one. That's my dojo.",Lily
6,3, Unfinished, You have a dojo?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished, I took an introductory karate class.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished, Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished, But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished, How long ago did you take that class?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, ""Wassuuuuuuup!""",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, I might.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",Lily
6,3, Unfinished, I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," No! Barney's been ""putting the moves"" on Ted.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks!  Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks!  Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, He did.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, And the intense eye contact thing?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Okay. Yep.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished, You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, That is so true.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," So at any point in this did you say, ""Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job""?",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",Ted
6,3, Unfinished, You're loving this.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished, No.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, You are. You're loving the attention.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, I am not that kind of architect. So get this...,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, Robin never deleted Don's number.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, Edwin.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Probably not, baby.",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, Okay. Your turn.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," Barney, I gotta tell you something.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished," Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Okay, I'll do it!",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," What? Ted, it's too late.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",Barney
6,3, Unfinished," Okay, it's a move.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, What?,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, Dude!,Barney
6,3, Unfinished," There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished, You guys lied to me?,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished, I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!,Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished, We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished," No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",Ted
6,3, Unfinished, 236.,Barney
6,3, Unfinished,"...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished," No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Hey, guys.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, I think that's just called a dog.,Marshall
6,3, Unfinished," Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
6,3, Unfinished, Fine. I called Don again.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished, I thought you deleted his number.,Lily
6,3, Unfinished," I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",Lily
6,3, Unfinished," I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?",Ted
6,3, Unfinished," Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",Barney
6,3, Unfinished, Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,Ted
6,3, Unfinished, And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. And even though it didn't happen right away...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,3, Unfinished, Who is this?,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait.",Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Robin finally got some closure, too.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,3, Unfinished, Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that.,Robin
6,3, Unfinished," Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job.",Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, What's wrong?,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, I don't want to talk about it.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," That sucks. I've been there, buddy.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.,Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House, Of course not. It's a two-day job.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, Pass.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Same.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Unsubscribe.,Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, No one believes that story.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.",Lily
6,2, Cleaning House, How did he do that?,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House, So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,2, Cleaning House," Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Yeah, that's what your mom said.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, How dare you!,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," No, she actually said that.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?",James
6,2, Cleaning House, Bro!,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, How you doing?,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Hey!,James
6,2, Cleaning House, Mama.,James
6,2, Cleaning House, Mom. Stop.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?",James
6,2, Cleaning House, Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, you know, how funny you are...",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Guilty.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Handsome.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House," Who, me?",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Incredible lover.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Really?,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, ""He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours..."" Blah, blah, blah. ""Orgasms so intense that you just black out."" All that stuff.",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House," Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Maybe I did oversell you a bit.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.,James
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, That sounds plausible.,Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.",James
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, Thank you.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?,Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.",James
6,2, Cleaning House, Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, I don't know... That guy.",Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House," Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House," No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.",James
6,2, Cleaning House, Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was ""sick"" and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4"" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House, And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House, I always find that reassuring.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," You will meet her, buddy.",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House, You think so?,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Yeah!,Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House, Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House, I'm not lying to our kids.,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House, Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.",James
6,2, Cleaning House," Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, No idea. Why?,James
6,2, Cleaning House, Mom addressed this and never sent it.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, What's in it?,James
6,2, Cleaning House," Hey.  It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son.""",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?",Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House," Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?",James
6,2, Cleaning House, That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?,Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House," There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote ""your son"" on the back.",James
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, no, that... It says ""Yourson."" For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?",Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House," If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?",James
6,2, Cleaning House," I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!",Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House, Can you believe her?,James
6,2, Cleaning House," I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, How?,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.""",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," ""Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.""",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House," See, now you went too far in the other...",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," ""I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.""",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Stop!,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.",James
6,2, Cleaning House," Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.",James
6,2, Cleaning House," I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House, Not now.,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?",James
6,2, Cleaning House," So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.,James
6,2, Cleaning House, Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.,Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, what's done is done.",Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," ""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn.",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, What?,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, That last bump just made me hit send.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, no.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House," No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. ""Everyone""?",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," ""Really rich""?",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, You ready for this?,James
6,2, Cleaning House," For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, I thought you said that he... Stop.,James
6,2, Cleaning House," Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, Come here.,James
6,2, Cleaning House, Yeah... you're Sam Gibbs.,James
6,2, Cleaning House," I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson... in the '70s.",James
6,2, Cleaning House, My mother meant to send you this.,James
6,2, Cleaning House," God, this must be so hard for Barney.",Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well.",James
6,2, Cleaning House," Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, He's also quite the detective.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," Or, he could just let him have this one.",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House, What?,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Are you kidding?,Lily
6,2, Cleaning House," Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",Marshall
6,2, Cleaning House," Here, Ted. Capture the moment!",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.",Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,2, Cleaning House, Weird day.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, Weird day.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, Maybe a little.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, You said she was a ten.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House, I did not specify on what scale.,Robin
6,2, Cleaning House, You said she looked like a movie star.,Ted
6,2, Cleaning House," She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.",Robin
6,2, Cleaning House," Dad, look how fast I can run!",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son.",James
6,2, Cleaning House, His name's Eli.,James
6,2, Cleaning House," Dad, you're not looking!",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,2, Cleaning House, Barney? I need to talk to you.,Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House," Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.",Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House, Are you sure?,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is.",Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House," And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,2, Cleaning House," What'd Coach say, Ma?",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.,Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House, Why didn't anyone come?,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. ""Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize ""for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party.""",Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House, Barney.,Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House," It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.",Barney
6,2, Cleaning House, But it's your father.,Loretta
6,2, Cleaning House, I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.,Barney
6,2, Cleaning House," Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom.",Future Ted(Narrator)

5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, Have you seen my show?,Robin
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," I wanted to watch it but I was too busy sleeping with this story. It took me all night, after 8 hours of the clock.",Ted
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," It's not serious, but listen to this! After the show...",Robin

5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, Yes.,Robin
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," I'm Don, your new co-presenter.",Man

5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," No, I just think it will be great both on the air.",Robin
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," And on the couch, the bed and on the coffee table.",Ted
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," Ok, ok, I'll go on the roof and stay there all alone 5 minutes.",Robin
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, Have fun.,Ted
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," And that's exactly what she did. She just stayed there. Okay kids, I'm a little liar with you. This is not what she did.That's what she did.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," Okay, okay, I'll go smoke a cigarette.",Robin
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," I promised never to tell you. But occasionally, your Aunt Robin was enjoying a cigarette. And occasionally, the occasional cigarette. Was more than just casual.",Future Ted(Narrator)

5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, last cigarette of my life.,Marshall
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," What are you doing, you have not smoked in 6 months. Is it about ""MacGrib""? It closed guy, forget it.",Ted
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," I'm worried about work, ok? They just hired a new chief legal department... and it will turn people.",Marshall
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, So that's why you're worried?,Ted
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, The new head of legal department is Hobes Arthur.,Barney
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, Is Arthur artillery? Your former leader.,Ted
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, Arthur Hobes is the worst leaders as Marshall or anyone have had. The last time Marshall had worked for him... it ended like that.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, I quit!,Marshall

5,11, Last Cigarette Ever, Worse!,Marshall
5,11, Last Cigarette Ever," Sorry, who are you?",Arthur

5,24, Doppelgangers," They told me, so I've prepared a few. I organize a ""marriage"". Tell me, Billy Idol, it's going to do? More on Billy Idol.If someone wants the real Slim Shady, it's there. This one was good. Robin, why do not you help me?",Barney
5,24, Doppelgangers," First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.",Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers, It gets no compliments.,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers, The other thing.,Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers, It may be that I moved to Chicago next week.,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers," Just to know, but it would do the same if we had not seen the Barney look-alike, eh?",Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers," But we have seen, which means that the universe in its infinite wisdom, tell me of planting, and apply yourself.",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, I can not. I can in good conscience you plant.,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, I know what's bothering you.,Lily

5,24, Doppelgangers, Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.,Barney
5,24, Doppelgangers, I think Robin...,Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers," Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.",Barney
5,24, Doppelgangers, It was smaller than Barney!,Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, It was the same size!,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers," And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, this guy was a little Asian with a graying goatee and belly.",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, You forgot what looks like Barney?,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, You kiss?,Barney
5,24, Doppelgangers, Why are you in our room?  Why are you in our room?  Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, It works!,Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers," Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has ""forgotten"" to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.",Barney
5,24, Doppelgangers," What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers," By omission, because this idea of ""let the world decide"" is crazy.",Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers," Baby, you...",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, We must control our...,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.,Barney

5,24, Doppelgangers," Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept.",Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers, I can not believe that Robin is going to lose.,Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers," And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair.",Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers, Finally.,Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, I told you so.,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, Not so great that.,Barney
5,24, Doppelgangers, So I was on the phone with Chicago.,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers," Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you.",Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers, I'm staying.,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers," Tell me... Did you see the real Barney driving the taxi, and you thought it was a little Asian pot-bellied.",Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers," I know. It's weird, huh?",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney.,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers, You'll never believe it. I was offered the position of presenter WNKW in Chicago.,Don

5,24, Doppelgangers, This is something that was cool 8 years ago.,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, What's your name?,Lily

5,24, Doppelgangers," I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.",Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers," Barney, why are you doing this?",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, Wait a second. Is it possible that Barney Stinson secretly hope they have children?,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years.,Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers," But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing.",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers," And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family.",Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers, Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.,Woman

5,24, Doppelgangers, Yes.,Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers, I can re-move?  Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers," Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.",Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers, Seems like I become more and more stupid.,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers," Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The ""Robin, there was 5 years""? This girl was pretty cool. Robin lookalike? She's great.  We drank a lot.",Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers, I do not care.,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers," What? I forgot, I'm blond. I have blonde hair.",Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers," And here's how my hair bleached prevented us from doing anything that would have regretted. Children, the world is fun.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,24, Doppelgangers, Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!,Lily
5,24, Doppelgangers," Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least.",Barney

5,24, Doppelgangers, It looks like Barney.,Robin
5,24, Doppelgangers, Amazing.,Ted
5,24, Doppelgangers, It's like looking in a mirror.,Barney
5,24, Doppelgangers," But ultimately, we see only what we want to see, when you're ready to see it.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,24, Doppelgangers, Does that mean...?,Marshall
5,24, Doppelgangers, Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.,Lily
5,13, Jenkins," You're not serious, my students are going to catch me so I do them a lesson. I have not even my slide projector.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Ted, I'm champion of skee-ball, since law school. I have come here at least once a month to keep my record.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," Looks like you're not income from a lease, a guy called ""Big caramel"" you're passed.",Ted

5,13, Jenkins, Yes.,Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Ok, I confess! It all started a few weeks.",Marshall

5,13, Jenkins," That night, I spoke to Lily.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, I'm in a hurry to meet him.,Lily
5,13, Jenkins," I should correct, it would have been so simple.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," But I have not done. So now, whenever I talk about Jenkins, I avoid pronouns.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," So the manager comes to marketing staff to choose Midwest. So he, he, he, she, him, him, Jenkins, him, her.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," Look, I understand why you have not told him? You really think she would be jealous too.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Ted, think of the stories I've told.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," Yes, it could be a problem.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Exactly, that's why Lily can know nothing.",Marshall

5,13, Jenkins," Because we love to madness, right?",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, Yes of course. Let's eat.,Lily
5,13, Jenkins, It was not jealous at all.,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins, What is this supposed to mean?,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high.",Robin
5,13, Jenkins," Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped.",Robin
5,13, Jenkins," No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse.",Robin
5,13, Jenkins, What?,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, Try your luck.,Robin

5,13, Jenkins," Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins, The what?,Ted
5,13, Jenkins, But huh?,Barney
5,13, Jenkins," But um, it would seem, she often said.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach...",Barney
5,13, Jenkins, It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.,Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said ""But um"" so often?",Barney
5,13, Jenkins," Tonight, we saw how much she often said.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,13, Jenkins," It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?",Robin
5,13, Jenkins, Oh that's good. But hmm. But um...,Robin
5,13, Jenkins, Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong.,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, Let me see.,Lily
5,13, Jenkins," It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think?",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, I think sometimes it's the case.,Lily
5,13, Jenkins, But not for us?,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," No, of course not.",Lily
5,13, Jenkins," Sure. Imagine, you have a gun to his head, you have to say that one of us is low.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," I would say this is me, this is what is right.",Lily
5,13, Jenkins," Now, the gun is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," No, no weak or strong.",Lily
5,13, Jenkins, So this...,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," It went on for a while, until finally...",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,13, Jenkins, And Oprah has tried everything?,Lily
5,13, Jenkins, Everything you need to decide now.,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong.",Lily
5,13, Jenkins, How can you say such a thing!,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Yes, an ordinary night for the ""Big caramel.""",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, Do you think she was flirting with me?,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, Bluntly.,Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the ""Big caramel""... may move, ok let me try again.",Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," Okay, I understand.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Ted, I have a great idea.",Robin
5,13, Jenkins, Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat.,Ted
5,13, Jenkins," If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn.",Robin
5,13, Jenkins," Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins," Look, just because your class prefers me to you...",Robin
5,13, Jenkins,... You're a drinking game.,Ted
5,13, Jenkins, What?,Robin
5,13, Jenkins," That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say ""But um"", they take a shot.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins, But umm?,Robin
5,13, Jenkins, Yes.,Ted
5,13, Jenkins," I'm not But um, I never told But hum.",Robin
5,13, Jenkins," So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Barney, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this.",Ted
5,13, Jenkins, Hey Jenkins!,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins," So, Lily and I go back to university bar. And you wonder if maybe you would come... You could watch me play skee-ball... do exactly what you did the other night, something like that. It's really up to you, I mean...",Marshall

5,13, Jenkins," Baby! That is, it's a name I do not deserve.",Marshall

5,13, Jenkins," Oh, I see what happens. That's about all that history of strong and weak.",Lily
5,13, Jenkins, You're sure it's not a fever?,Marshall
5,13, Jenkins, You wanna make me jealous so you invent a story with Jenkins.,Lily
5,13, Jenkins," I did not invent it! It happened, this woman kissed me.With language, his tongue was in my mouth.",Marshall

5,13, Jenkins, And that's when that Robin had an idea that would end the game forever.,Future Ted(Narrator)

5,13, Jenkins," And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can.",Marshall

5,14, Perfect Week," Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show.",Barney
5,14, Perfect Week," It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history.",Jim

5,14, Perfect Week," How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.",Robin

5,15, Rabbit or Duck," See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has.

5,15, Rabbit or Duck, I do not love Don.,Robin
5,15, Rabbit or Duck," Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.",Marshall

5,16, Hooked, So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.,Marshall
5,16, Hooked, Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?,Barney
5,16, Hooked, There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.,Robin
5,16, Hooked, I want you to meet the latest arrival.,Woman
5,16, Hooked, Let's go have a drink.,Woman
5,16, Hooked, It's over.,Barney
5,16, Hooked, What?,Robin
5,16, Hooked, The girls of pharma are more than gunnery. This is the end of an era.,Barney
5,16, Hooked, You're a little dramatic.,Robin
5,16, Hooked," Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!",Barney
5,16, Hooked, So that night I went to live in Henrietta prepared to release it from my hook.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,16, Hooked, I'm done.,Ted
5,16, Hooked, It's worse.,Ted
5,16, Hooked," Yeah, there was a...",Ted
5,16, Hooked, What did you do?,Robin
5,16, Hooked," Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart.",Ted
5,16, Hooked," Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.",Ted
5,16, Hooked, Ever.,Ted
5,16, Hooked, It was violent.,Ted
5,16, Hooked," Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative.  I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?",Robin
5,16, Hooked, Another tour.,Mike
5,16, Hooked, It can wait.,Robin
5,16, Hooked, How are you?,Robin
5,16, Hooked, You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?,Ted
5,16, Hooked, I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.,Barney
5,16, Hooked, Why change your mind?,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, You want to install?,Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Well... it's a bit early... but... of course, I might consider... I moved here, let me think.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," I mean, you can install yourself beyond me to sit?",Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Yeah, that's what I was talking about me too. As I said, let me think. I agree.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, But... now that you've mentioned... you wanna install?,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, You said what?,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, I thought about it.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," We have the same job, Barney.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," And we could not be more proud of you, my angel.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, It still seems fast.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, You're probably right.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, You should live with him.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Really?,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, You wanna throw me out because of something with milk?,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, It's super boring.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Robin?!,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, I promise.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, It's good.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, And it was Barney.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, It's not bad.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Actually, I'm not sure.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, I think it's great. But I pity any woman with self-esteem so low it would go out with him.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,21, Twin Beds," I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," There, he knew it.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,21, Twin Beds, So Barney's your ex and you hang out with him? It makes me uncomfortable.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds," The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," How was your weekend, or any other topic?",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, Atrocious.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, Terrible.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds," Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second......",Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, You can come back later? It takes a nap.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, We spent 18 hours.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, We missed the full board.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, I lost 5 kg.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, It's not weird that Robin is still friends with Barney?,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, It's odd that we all still be friends with Barney.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, I do not know how to react to the fact that she hangs out with an ex.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, Robin had said nothing either to Don about another of his ex. Me.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,21, Twin Beds," Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. sh1t, two is even better. Because strawberry...",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, But if you had someone and he hung out with an ex...,Don

5,21, Twin Beds, Your ink arrived.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, Yes.,Ted

5,21, Twin Beds, But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Thank you. Ted is not it?,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, Ted will not be much there. It follows Cher's tour.,Robin

5,21, Twin Beds," Lily, be honest. It's not weird that Robin train with an ex?",Don
5,21, Twin Beds, Ted and Robin broke up there for years. This is not a problem.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, Ted? And Robin?,Don
5,21, Twin Beds," I'm so gay, eh, Donnie?",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Thank you.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," You're also out with Ted? 4 people you consider your best friends, you've slept with 50% of them.",Don
5,21, Twin Beds, It's just my friends.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, But they are also your ex. And you live with one of them.I'm sorry. I have to think about all that.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, It should have separate beds.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, a deal!,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Not at all.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, That was after you to be part.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," I acts as a hysteric. It's not offensive, right?",Don
5,21, Twin Beds, Still not gay.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Sorry, I meant you're both important to Robin. How about dinner tomorrow night at home.",Don

5,21, Twin Beds," So long, guys.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, I have to get Robin.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Are you kidding?,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, You ready.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Ready for what?,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, To read the letter.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Children, I invented the letter to remind me of the reasons for a breakup. I did it for years.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,21, Twin Beds," Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who beat you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before...,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,21, Twin Beds, Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Write it.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, What?,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Right?,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, You... and Robin...,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds,"... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Get it?,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, I understand. I really want it back.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," Humans are not made to share a bed. s*x and sleep are associated, but these are two different things.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds," I know. I love you, but I want this new bed is a sanctuary of my sleep and my sleep only.",Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," Me too. And snacks, but that's all. You know what we should do? Buy a third bed to make love.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, A bed for s*x. For hot s*x and bestiality.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," Awesome. That way, each bed will have its uses.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds," Right. There will be two beds for sleeping, one for s*x, and I thought an ottoman for birthdays.",Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," Baby, you come to revolutionize modern marriage?",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, And how.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, Do you like sushi?,Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, It's too easy.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying ""Sit wherever you want, except on that chair."" You will be so...",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, My chair!,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, From spicy tuna? My favorite.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," I do too. It is more spicy, the better.",Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, You will not believe. Don also has twin beds.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, We just had.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, Great. Super.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Wait. This ""super"" does not look great.",Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, My ex and I thought it would be a good idea but they separated.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, But I bet you have no special bed s*x.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds," It yes, with his personal trainer.",Don
5,21, Twin Beds, This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," But if Robin decides to move, I bought a giant bed.",Don
5,21, Twin Beds, I would love. If I move.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, If you moved in.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Great! Give her milk!,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," spit, spit!",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," We have more milk. Thank you for the reminder, Robin.",Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Well, I hope you're happy.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, You were emptied from the top and bottom.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, For my biographer?,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And sh1t. I want it back.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," So that night, with Barney, we sat down to talk calmly and reasonably to the most deserving Robin.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,21, Twin Beds, I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds,"... I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Of course.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, We all talk!,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, I'm worried. I do not want that divorce.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," This is Don. It's not us. Our new way to sleep is only going to get closer. Now, get out of my bed.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, We can at least get closer?,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," Sure. You spoke of the beds. No, I'm not.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, Why?,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," I love you more than anything, but you're worse than a kettle. I'm surprised that your pee breaks are not as steam.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, We're getting closer?,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, You speak of beds yet?,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, Nope.,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, Come here.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, Robin Stinson!,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Robin Mosby!,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Robin Stinson!,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break...,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, It's BarnExclussif.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," BarnExclussif, not quit. I have a double appeal.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey?,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, What's the matter?,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, We almost lose control.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," Robin, I love you!",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Species of b*st*rd! I brought the blue French horn!,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, I want you back!,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Come on, get.",Don
5,21, Twin Beds," All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Something to three.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Robin and I have to go to work. Sit down watching TV and will be discussed when we come back, okay?",Don
5,21, Twin Beds," You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, We won the fingers in the nose...,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Where's this great TV?,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Right there.,Don
5,21, Twin Beds, Thank you.,Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," You're welcome. Good night, guys.",Don
5,21, Twin Beds," Good night, Dad.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," It was good. Well, you gotta go.",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, What?,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds," I'm sorry. It was great and you're great. But, I must get up early, so...",Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds, You throw me like that?,Lily
5,21, Twin Beds, You knew before you start.  Wait. Forget your sweater. Nice try.,Marshall
5,21, Twin Beds," The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, Dad?,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," We get up, fuckers. You remember last night?",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds," Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing...",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don.",Robin
5,21, Twin Beds, So what's going on with Robin?,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of sh1t.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past.",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Let me see!,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Give me that.,Barney
5,21, Twin Beds," Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.",Ted
5,21, Twin Beds," In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?",Barney
5,21, Twin Beds, Too great.,Ted
5,21, Twin Beds, Robin?!,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Kids, as you know, Aunt Robin grew up in Canada. That meant sometimes she dressed &agrave; little differently.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Okay, let's do this!",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Sometimes she talked a little differently.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh?",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, She hung out at different bars and enjoyed leisure time a little differently.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," The... mmm. Social experiment.  U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A...",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in.  Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, No!,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, What Gazzola's?,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago just for Gazzola's pizza.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," 22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Drank nothing but Tantrum.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Ah, Tantrum. Tantrum was a soft drink with the highest caffeine content legally available over the counter. It was eventually discontinued after an extensive study by the FDA.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I was color blind for two weeks after that.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned though the can, the other one I drank already.  Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an ""I"" to a ""We"".",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, What do you mean?,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Think about it.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Do you watch the Jets game?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, We most certainly did.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, How'd things go at the doctor?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Hmm.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges.,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Come on!,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, A cit...,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I'll think about it.,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Okay, Barney.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Sorry. It's a rich area.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, It is.,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, How do you know the Canadian test is easy?,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Tantrum!,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Tantrum!,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," All right, let's hit the road.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, You invited Lily?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, We most certainly did!,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," I don't know if you caught that, but he did the ""we"" thing.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Yeah, I heard him.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Okay.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.,Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I have to pee.,Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Couldn't you have gone before we left?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.,Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, It wasn't.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Ow!,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Thank you!,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Great. Oh, hey, Ted...",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Goodbye, Sparky.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.,Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Oh!,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," ""How many stars are on the flag?""",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," 50, one for each state.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," ""What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?""",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Queen Elizabeth II.,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Wrong. The answer we were looking for was ""I don't care, it's dumb"". Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Ah, I do.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," It was the worst trip ever, but then it got worse.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Hotel?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Crumpet Manor is listed in the American Registry of Historic Bed and Breakfasts. Our door is opened on Christmas day, 1881. And we have catered to couples ever since.",Woman
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?",Woman
5,5, Duel Citizenship," And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I want to say- Jefferson?,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Correct.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Oh!,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your guns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Look who's back from the wishing well.,Woman
5,5, Duel Citizenship," It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?",Woman
5,5, Duel Citizenship, And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.,Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all.  Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country.  *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Hey, man.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Shh.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Chicago.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," If she's pissed, she's pissed.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Pfft.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Good morning.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, You went Canadian.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, How Canadian?,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, This Canadian.  Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," How did you find me, anyway?",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Canada isn't across the Atlantic.,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Barney, I'm not taking the test.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," God, you're still drunk.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Kind of cross.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Just like old times!,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I feel so young again except for the chest pains.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.,Man
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Cornmeal...,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!,Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I can't believe you guys are closing.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.,Man
5,5, Duel Citizenship, It's like an entire country without a tailor.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Yeah, give me two coffees.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, What game?,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, I guess I missed it.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I'm not American.,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I don't want this anymore.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, We shouldn't have left Lily.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!""",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," What exactly is ""Ted's fault""?",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, That is not true.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," I'm sorry, ted!",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?",Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Hells, yeah!",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Or listen to the Sparky book again?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Listen to the Sparky book again.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Okay. Let's listen to it again.,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool.""",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Hmm.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Wait, you can do that?",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.",Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I see.,Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship, You understand?,Robin
5,5, Duel Citizenship," No, I can see out of my left eye again.",Barney
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Hey, baby? Baby?",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, Hmm? Yeah?,Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I'm so sorry that we left you.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Did you go somewhere, sweetie?",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," So, I had a great time, too.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship, That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.,Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Oh, that's okay.",Lily
5,5, Duel Citizenship," And if she didn't mean it then, she certainly meant it 19 minutes later.",Future Ted(Narrator)
5,5, Duel Citizenship," God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, It's like a hot ball of lead!,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," Baby, cut it out of me.",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship," That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?",Marshall
5,5, Duel Citizenship, I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?,Ted
5,5, Duel Citizenship," You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Nice! Where'd you get this?,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you.,Marshall
6,1, Big Days," And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous?,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers.",Ted
6,1, Big Days, A sun dress.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?",Barney
6,1, Big Days, I really have to get this done.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Of course, of course.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, Thank you.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," ""Sun dress,"" by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock...",Barney
6,1, Big Days," Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!",Ted
6,1, Big Days, I want to see a pretty girl.,Barney
6,1, Big Days," Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, And what's that word?,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Dibs!,Barney
6,1, Big Days, What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.,Ted
6,1, Big Days, You never called dibs.,Barney
6,1, Big Days, Dibs were implied.,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Implied dibs?,Barney
6,1, Big Days, Yeah.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...",Barney
6,1, Big Days," Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.",Ted
6,1, Big Days, And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!,Barney
6,1, Big Days, Damn it!,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Where is Marshall anyway?,Barney
6,1, Big Days, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family. Tonight was their first at-bat.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,1, Big Days," Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Check.,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Music to set the mood?,Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Check.,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Music for when we're actually doing it?,Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Check.,Lily
6,1, Big Days, You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Actually, Marshall would probably be...",Ted
6,1, Big Days, As your best man...,Barney
6,1, Big Days, Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs.,Barney
6,1, Big Days, No!,Ted
6,1, Big Days, What?,Barney
6,1, Big Days, I had implied dibs.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Shhh, shh. You're the victim here. We both are. Let's get out of here.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, We could just do it right here.,Barney
6,1, Big Days, Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, ""Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny."" That is not what ""shields up"" looks like.  That is what ""shields up"" looks like.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," Move. God!  Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, No fries for this guy.,Robin
6,1, Big Days," Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.",Ted
6,1, Big Days, With hygiene?,Barney
6,1, Big Days," No, with Don. A few months earlier...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,1, Big Days," Here, have some tea.",Ted
6,1, Big Days, Thanks.,Robin
6,1, Big Days," Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no.",Robin
6,1, Big Days, Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Okay, I'm ready to have s*x now.",Robin
6,1, Big Days," It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto?",Ted
6,1, Big Days," No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? ",Robin
6,1, Big Days," This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a ""de-rection.""",Barney
6,1, Big Days, Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Nope!,Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Okay, so, here's what happened. I was at home, waiting for Marshall.",Lily
6,1, Big Days," Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall!",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Marshall, whoa! Wait. A big package just arrived.",Lily
6,1, Big Days," Yeah, it did.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," No, no. It's a real package from your dad.",Lily
6,1, Big Days," Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Marshall, look!",Lily
6,1, Big Days," A bassinet? Oh, my... He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.,Marshall
6,1, Big Days," We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," I have read 11 books on conception. I have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar. I take my temperature every hour. But good for you for not playing with yourself.",Lily
6,1, Big Days," I feel you, buddy.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously.  Okay, I'm better now.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?",Ted
6,1, Big Days, Excuse me?,Barney
6,1, Big Days, Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.,Barney
6,1, Big Days, 20 bucks.,Ted
6,1, Big Days, But I... Can I go smell her first?,Barney
6,1, Big Days, No. ,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Fine. ,Barney
6,1, Big Days, All right. Wish me luck.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Now kids, remember how I told you about a girl named Cindy? [FLASHBACK - Cindy's appartment] How I went on one date with her and it ended...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,1, Big Days, badly? Well... [END OF FLASHACK],Future Ted(Narrator)
6,1, Big Days, What the hell are you doing?,Barney
6,1, Big Days, That girl she's talking to? I dated her.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Oh, that sucks! And dibs.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Then I remembered. Cindy had a roommate. A roommate I only caught a glimpse of... But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special. Was it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle?",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,1, Big Days, I got to see her ankles.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office?,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Shannon? Start the music...,Marshall
6,1, Big Days," I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings...",Lily
6,1, Big Days, Hello.,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Hello.,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Hello.,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Pickles would have helped that sandwich!,Marshall
6,1, Big Days, The man has no boundaries. And I just can't procreate under these conditions!,Lily
6,1, Big Days," Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.",Lily
6,1, Big Days," Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Only if you want to give this a stroke.,Lily
6,1, Big Days," That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think!",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, They're talking to a guy now.,Robin
6,1, Big Days, What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy?,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, Jealous?,Robin
6,1, Big Days," Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, I have not lost it.,Robin
6,1, Big Days, You lost it.,Barney
6,1, Big Days," I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.,Robin
6,1, Big Days," Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.,Lily
6,1, Big Days," So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, ""I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.""",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Out for three months?,Lily
6,1, Big Days, Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.,Marshall
6,1, Big Days," No, we didn't.",Lily
6,1, Big Days," I meant, me and my dad.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?",Lily
6,1, Big Days," Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, What?,Lily
6,1, Big Days, I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!,Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Yeah, she definitely saw you.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Okay, will do. And dibs.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?",Lily
6,1, Big Days," Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, Why not?,Lily
6,1, Big Days," If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, That was really...,Lily
6,1, Big Days," Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!",Barney
6,1, Big Days, Brief.,Lily
6,1, Big Days," No. Lily, look.  You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," 14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Robin, you do look super hot.",Barney
6,1, Big Days," Oh, do I?",Robin
6,1, Big Days," Yeah, you do.",Barney
6,1, Big Days, Thanks.,Robin
6,1, Big Days," Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.",Ted
6,1, Big Days, Totally.,Ted
6,1, Big Days, Say good-bye before you leave?,Robin
6,1, Big Days, Her words exactly.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!",Barney
6,1, Big Days," She didn't see us high-six, did she?",Ted
6,1, Big Days, No. Good. That was pretty lame.,Barney
6,1, Big Days," Yeah, let's never do that again.",Ted
6,1, Big Days, Marshall?,Lily
6,1, Big Days," What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Here's the thing.,Lily
6,1, Big Days," I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Dad, this is...",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.",Lily
6,1, Big Days," Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?,Lily
6,1, Big Days," Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.,Ted
6,1, Big Days," Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it. And that night, by golly, Cindy went for it. So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother. She ended up being someone else's mother. In fact, they both did.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,1, Big Days," Like I said, she's here on a date.",Robin
6,1, Big Days, So that was not the day I met your mother. The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,1, Big Days," Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Dude, it's just a wedding toast.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days," I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.",Ted
6,1, Big Days, It will be.,Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
6,1, Big Days," Geez, what now?",Ted
6,1, Big Days," Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, Yeah. You were saying?,Ted
6,1, Big Days," You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?",Marshall
6,1, Big Days, No. I didn't bring an umbrella.,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Okay. That man is terrifying.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Keep smiling. He can still see us.,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Okay.,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy.  But the top half of his face...wants to murder you! Cheerful. Wants to murder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to murder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Captain, what do you think of rainy days?",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Whoa, he hates them.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Ooh. What-What is that?,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, He hates that he loves them.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Running the water.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Holding the towel.,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, And the most important rule of all...,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Lubricant is public property. ,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Please.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, No lying to the spouse about anything you do.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," No doubt, Robo Cop.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us.",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Oh! Sweet. No candles.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Nah.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Wait. No. It had to be more than just, ""Nah."" Oh, I think she said...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, You're a big... stupid octopus head!,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night...",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.",Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?",Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, It's totally okay.,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. ""Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""""I love your mom""""I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it"""" Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, What's wrong with this shirt?,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, December chill... so great.,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Totally.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory,...sports...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Did you catch the game last night?,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Yeah. Nail-biter.,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory,...and cold weather sports.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, They are fun.,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Man, this is awkward.",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Lots of drinks.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Oh, so many drinks.",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing?",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Barney.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Watch out!,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Wait. They were on the street.,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Watch out!,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I think I probably didn't.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Like I said, the fight was just getting started.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Robin, I'm an attorney.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Fine. This night's a little awkward.,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Why is that?,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," So, who's the eye broccoli?",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I'm sorry. Myth?,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Did we bet on this?,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Let's say yes.,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Big-time manatee.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, What were those sailors thinking?,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this.  Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," He's gonna kill me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Want to hang?,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Nah. Watch out!,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, You're a jerk.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," How now? Oh, bother.  Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Head?,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," 200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.,Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory,"And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Ted?,Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Am I blushing or...?,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory,"...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' ""Part of Your World"" to my pants.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I asked Barney the same thing.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Death?,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Pregnancy?,Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, That was it! I remember now!,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face!",Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Oh... You're a jerk.,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory,What's that?,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Breast-feeding. Hot.,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Really?,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.,Barney
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, That's so sweet!,Lily
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, See kids? Told you I'd get it!,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Okay, now we're even!",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, So you really thought I was gonna kill you?,Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Well... ish.,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.",Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is.,Captain
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yeah, me, too.",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see...,Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!",Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Uh-oh. I don't feel so good.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",Robin
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I really do.,Marshall
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever.",Future Ted(Narrator)
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Hey, Ted.",Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, Hey. You feeling better?,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.,Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, You weren't?,Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together.",Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous.",Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," Me, too.",Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory," I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?",Ted
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, No. Do you?,Zoey
6,11, The Mermaid Theory, No.,Ted
